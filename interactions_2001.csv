21694,5139,2001-10-22,5,"Very good, wonderful dinner during cold nights."
18660,12572,2001-11-02,5,"The combination of crescent rolls and savory chicken filling was delicious. If you ever want to jazz up a chicken salad sandwich, this filling would go well on any type of bread. The ingredients blend well together. I used low fat canned chcicken as a time saver and reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat crescent rolls to save on calories. Would go well with a salad."
4005,8507,2001-04-22,5,"This is a delicious, healthy and beautiful salad that takes only minutes to prepare.  I look forward to the homegrown tomatoes and basil from my garden."
8000,8507,2001-06-12,5,"Sounds good.  I would mince the basil, and place it directly on the tomatoes."
12756,8507,2001-07-17,5,"This recipe is *awesome*, but here's a nifty little hint:

Instead of regular mozzarella, use buffalo mozzarella.  Add cucumbers to this dish, and spoon a homemade salsa relish (think tomatoes, not heat) on top of the cheese.

A superb little dish!"
16481,8507,2001-08-29,0,"I agree with the other comments (use fresh mozerella, etc.) It's hard to find in some areas. Trader Joe's has it. Italian deli's have it, if you are lucky enough to have one where you live. I just have one suggestion. Drizzle on some Balsamic vinegar along with the olive oil. I travelled all over Italy last summer and ate this salad everywhere. Many places added the Balsamic and it makes a good salad really good!"
17095,8507,2001-08-31,5,This is a great light salad.  Even my children love it.  I like to add a little fresh cracked black pepper to it.
12777,8507,2001-10-20,3,"actually, switching avacado slices for the mozzarella, and adding a homemade french dressing makes it absolutely fabulous, and do use basil."
19724,503,2001-11-26,4,"I am Malaysian and I have an awesome satay recipe that takes over 12 hours to make (much chopping, blending and overnight marinating required). This one took me about 30 minutes and used ingredients found in almost any American kitchen. For the sauce I used chunky peanut butter (I didn't want a smooth peanut paste), a pinch of cayenne pepper instead of chili sauce and added a tbsp of maple syrup (the Malaysian satay peanut sauce is sweet and spicy). Bottomline: Authentic-tasting? Not really. Easy? YES."
7119,8905,2001-11-02,0,A very nice change from the usual tomato based spaghetti sauce.
2625,7379,2001-05-24,0,"Weird. This reminds me of Buster Douglas.  

Why so complicated? Why bother having oysters at all?  This recipe would probably work with seitan. Or, possibly...yes."
21618,10602,2001-10-20,5,Excellent
13667,4527,2001-08-03,5,"tried this recipe on my boyfriend, who dislikes asian food of ant sort. didn't tell him
name of recipe or ingred., until after when he said he loved it. we have had it several
times since. have brought to pot luck dinner parties... every one who has tasted it,
raved."
9869,8587,2001-12-10,5,"These are delicious with a capital 'D'..I have made these to include in my Christmas goody gifts...ahem ahem, I've eaten 3 in a row!
The pastry is melt in your mouth, the filling divine, thank you so much!"
21987,12044,2001-10-24,5,"This Is definitley the best stew i have had yet i used beef insead of Venison since i didnt have any
but i also added 1 tablespoon of liquid smoke Marinade WOW!! its great you can also cook this is a crock pot for 6 hours on high"
13348,12044,2001-11-16,5,This is a great stew for venison or beef.  It's also great to freeze for later.
24217,12044,2001-11-27,5,"Great stew! I coat the meat with flour, salt and pepper before browning though.  That way you don't have to add it later to thicken the stew and you avoid that raw flour taste you ocasionally get when adding flour straight to a soup or stew."
16909,4470,2001-08-29,0,"True ""Southern Cornbread Dressing"" has sage added to your taste."
24296,3579,2001-11-23,5,VEARY  FAST  &  esay.
9869,11040,2001-10-19,5,"Bergy, this is absolutely delicious..Asparagus is one of my favourite vegetables..and I make a quick stove top using balsamic vinegar. But made like this and with the parmesan as well....it was superb. =)"
15841,10261,2001-09-26,4,This is a great recipe. We also cubed the squash which we liked better. The yellow zucchinni really worked well. Thanks
23326,14016,2001-11-10,0,"I think this recipe is cruel as Squirrels are kind & friendly creatures. They're also very cute. Maybe it's because I grew up reading ""Squirrel Nutkin"" books and have managed to cross the road safely ever since."
23668,14016,2001-11-14,1,"I agree with Guy.  All of us who have been members of the Tufty Club should rise up and put an end to this wanton cruelty. P.S. I happen to know that Guy is a driving instructor and is an expert on road safety, so his review is both well-informed and professional. Plus - I once tried to feed walnuts to the squirrels outside my window. Ha!"
23796,14016,2001-11-16,0,"given that a squirrel is not much more than a tree rat I'm suprised that anybody would even think of such a thing. Guy is right, up the squrrel liberation front."
11815,14016,2001-12-13,5,"I don't know where these guys come from, but where I come from small game hunting is the norm.  I just wish more people would do it as the squirrel, rabbit and other small game populations are climbing.

I haven't tried this recipe yet but I cant wait to skinn them little limb rats and munch on some grindage.

Keep hunting alive."
11882,5190,2001-08-15,5,My husband and I just loved this recipe. I am always looking for new and exciting recipes. This one made it on my list.
15572,5190,2001-12-22,4,"I used boneless pork chops, doubled the gravy recipe, and served it over toast.  Delicious."
5903,3470,2001-02-18,5,awesome....kids loved it!!!!!
6688,3470,2001-03-24,3,diff. brands of soup make it taste diff. but a very good meal for alazy day...
9869,13210,2001-11-09,5,"These were really good, the mustard gives them a great colour, and I should have listened to you and made more!"
9466,13210,2001-11-30,4,The caramelized onions are the best part.  Next time I will use 2 onions.  I also think that dijon mustard might be an interesting variation.
13483,13210,2001-12-16,5,I am always looking for new and interesting ways to serve vegetables.  This filled the bill.  It was excellent. The only thing I added was garlic as garlic goes with almost everything!!  Good recipe. Thanks
27130,16256,2001-12-27,5,Easy and delicious!
20754,7413,2001-11-10,4,This is a easy tasty recipe.  My whole family loved it.
15851,376,2001-08-21,5,yummy!  A good way to hide veggies from kids since they look and taste like hushpuppies!  We loved them
9869,14569,2001-12-25,5,"Such a simple dessert and really good too, this was a Christmas dessert for us, I had planned on making this a few weeks ago, sure glad I did."
5135,834,2001-03-19,5,"It was easy to make, had a great flavor, and my kids even liked it. I suggest more sauce than recipe calls for, because you will want to have it to spoon over burgers when served."
4470,834,2001-08-21,5,I love hamburgers and I love this recipe! This is so easy and comes out very tasty.  I wanted a tad more sauce so right at the end I added an oz of vodka mmmmm. Thanks for a really good recipe
16334,834,2001-08-23,5,"This sauce is so yummy, and the aroma is wonderful. I cooked 3 rump steaks instead, and doubled the sauce mixture, using small, frequent amounts to fry the steak in (and to put on top of the steak as a quick marinade), then using the bit left over to spoon over the steak and fried rice I made. I also used soy margarine instead of butter, dijon mustard and 1 freshly squeezed orange, because I ran out of lemons."
15572,834,2001-10-19,5,"Nummmmmy!  Add Lipton Onion Soup mix to the hamburger (actually I used ground turkey, less fat)  Make at least double the recipe for the sauce.  I made triple and it was just enough for the two of us.  Use Grey Poupon mustard.  This is easy to make and well worth the effort."
22023,834,2001-10-24,4,I really enjoyed this recipe.  I always need something new to make with hamburger meat.  It was sooo easy to make and it tasted wonderful.  And one of the bet parts was that I had all the ingredients.  I served it with greenbeans and mashed potatoes.
13483,834,2001-11-05,4,I paid attention to all the comments about making more sauce.  I fully understand why they were made!!  I love lemon anything and I added a bit more lemon than called for and it was delicious.  This is a recipe well worth doing again!!
19799,834,2001-12-28,5,"This recipe is awesome.I doubled the sauce and served it with baked potates,salad,and crusty rolls.Hubby said he felt like we were at a restaurant.Can't wait to try this out on my relatives when they visit."
6702,657,2001-11-23,5,"My bread loving family adored these rolls! My only change for next time is to make 16 rolls instead of 8, they were HUGE for dinner rolls! :) The leftover will be great for turkey sandwiches though. ;)"
3288,6819,2001-03-29,2,OK...but I thought it was missing some pizzaz.
21752,10208,2001-10-30,3,"The directions weren't the clearest I ever saw, but I managed to figure it all out, and this makes a pretty good cake!  There wasn't much left over after 24 hours."
12657,7917,2001-07-23,4,"Very tasty, but rather heavy smoothie. I'd like to try this recipe using water instead of milk, but that would make it a slush. Perhaps substituting half the milk with cold water would serve the purpose as well. 
The honey offers a very nice flavour to this smoothie."
14059,7917,2001-09-10,4,Great. Just when I thought I had kicked the smoothie habit....
8000,7585,2001-04-09,4,"I would pre-blanch a red potato, for about 15 minutes, peel and dice it, and add it to the water.
After adding the water, and lentils, I would add one peeled, diced, drained tomato.
Dash of this, and that; oregano, parsley, paprika, cayenne pepper, tobasco.
I would use 1 tbs of red wine vinegar, instead of 2 tbs of cider vinegar."
7934,7585,2001-04-18,4,"I would like to add the dashes of ""this and that"" according to John Skrable's ideas, this sounds very scrupmtious!!"
10291,7585,2001-05-30,4,"Lentilsoup is one of my favorite dishes and my Mom made it quite often because it was an inexpensive way to feed a whole family. In Germany we do not use the celery or the carrots in Lentilsoup, but I actually like that idea, gives it an extra little flavor. And yes we often use ham or even brown some bacon as added flavor.
The way I make it is, I cut about a quarter pound of bacon into strips, brown these, the put in one chopped onion and let it brown slightly until golden. I add water and the desired amount of lentils. Let it cook for about an hour. In a seperate saucepan I melt 3 tbs margarine and put in 3 tbs of flour, then I use about 3 tbs of vinegar take some of the already made lentil soup and mix it up good so you dont get lumps, transfer to lentil soup and stir well, let cook an additional half hour. Cut up some Frankfurters heat, and serve over Spaetzle.
Very famous dish in every Gasthaus in Germany."
18391,4779,2001-10-17,3,Not as good as i thought it would be .. sorry
7503,9861,2001-07-05,5,"YUM YUM!!!  WHAT a GREAT IDEA FOR SUMMER...These were great on a platter next to my 4th of JULY BBQ.  I FRIED A BUNCH AND THEY WENT PERFECTLY NEXT TO THE HOT DOGS AND RIBS...SO Easy and SO GOOD.  The kids were grabbin' them left and right.  I added a little OLD BAY to the Batter.  Thank Jen...Check out my Rib recipe, what a pair they made.  Beverly, NJ"
12392,9861,2001-07-16,4,this was a new one on me it' really good.
6357,9460,2001-08-08,0,Mohanthal is a favourite with Sindhi''s like myself:)
9121,13535,2001-11-05,5,This was absolutely delicious!  Thank you!!
16140,8952,2001-09-21,5,This was absolutely delicious!
19995,12100,2001-09-27,5,"I made these last night for my roomates. We ate them up so fast. I'm not a real experienced cook, but these where easy to make."
18660,12100,2001-10-06,5,"I have always loved stuffed mushrooms, but afraid to try to make them myself.  This recipe was tasty and easy.  Looks and tastes like a lot of work, but it's not!"
10216,8867,2001-11-23,5,swap letters for an obscenity in the second version(trust me to find that!) I dont know what galliano is... or why it should float
26416,11624,2001-12-26,1,"It sounds good, however, she does not give a ratio for the ingredients."
17084,11217,2001-10-01,5,What an awesome way to use up my zucchini (there always seems to be too much).  This recipe surprised my friends and family who couldn't believe there was more zucchini than tomato in it.  We found it was plenty hot with only 5 jalepenos.
27315,16051,2001-12-27,0,"My aussie husband visited Boston 25 years ago and came back raving about Popovers and till today I have not been able to find a recipe for them.
Thanks for saving my sanity and marriage
He is truly a content man now!"
2962,1595,2001-04-09,4,The recipe works well and is fairly flexable.  I have tried it without the lemon or with 4 chicken breasts instead of 3.
21694,12571,2001-11-01,4,"Very good, this dish also brought me to the fine bacon, which before this was not one of my favorites."
15451,10360,2001-08-30,0,"Correction regarding Ingredients
I feel that this recipe is lacking in a raising agent probably baking powderI feel that it requires 4 teaspoons .also I do not think it would be a good keeper [shortshelf life] as there is too little fat. which is what helps to extend the the shelf life.I will try them and report back.

Hilda.
 "
6357,10825,2001-09-16,4,Nice one...I also would like to add that some maraschino cherries scattered around would look good and very tempting as well as taste delicious....and maybe you could also sprinkle some chocolate chips on the top:)
21618,11051,2001-10-20,5,Very Impressive
13318,12571,2001-10-15,5,How pleased I was to find this recipe.  My husband is of Slovack decent and has grown up on food such as this.  We both enjoyed this recipe.
22302,12571,2001-10-29,5,"Hi Vicki- Cathy here - Yes we will print this recipe as well - thank you for posting it for all to enjoy -
Next time you make a batch - call us - and we will do the same.
I like both versions have you submitted the fattening butter and cottage cheese receipe?  That one is truly decadent!!  Let me know when you do!  Grandma Paquette would be so happy to learn that you have done this to carry on the traditions of the family....
Love to you all, 
Cathy"
20236,12116,2001-10-01,4,"The sauce was the best, I will try it on alot of other stuff."
16140,12116,2001-10-28,4,"A lovely side dish,this I will make again,I did,t have canned beets(not common here in S/Africa)so used cooked fresh ones."
21694,12515,2001-10-30,4,"A little bland, but still delicious."
21675,12978,2001-10-22,0,These are quite tasty and easy to make..
25919,15743,2001-12-15,4,A really useful recipe.  I love this sauce.
16459,11423,2001-11-08,5,These were great and very esy to make!
24230,14509,2001-11-26,4,"This was really fast, and very good.  I didn't add the caviar, but I think it tasted just fine without it, so did my Thanksgiving dinner guests."
7119,9232,2001-12-31,4,"I''m not a fan of sundried tomatoes, but this recipe was good, I added roasted garlic to spruce up the flavor a little. I also reduced the amount of lemon juice. otherwise a very good recipe. thank you for posting it."
19419,3713,2001-12-27,5,I was having four generations for Christmas dinner and was looking for something that I could prepare ahead and all would like. I cooked it up and put it in the crockpot on low so people could just serve themselves. It was a big hit with everyone from the 2 year old to the 87 year old matriarch. I think the new 2 week old was the only one who didn't have some.
18391,11577,2001-11-20,5,"I tried the green peas scramble, and this was even better!!"
6357,10088,2001-07-09,5,It brightened up the day and added to the romance in the air:)
17781,10088,2001-09-04,5,"This dessert is so wonderful! I wasn't sure I would like it because of the sour cream, but I think that's what makes it so good! Thanks."
22370,10088,2001-10-30,5,Very easy to make and tastes great!  The kids loved it too.  The evaporated milk and sour cream give it a distinct taste.  I would recommend it for a holiday meal or potluck.
15759,10088,2001-11-25,5,"Not hard at all to put together.
Looks pretty and taste is super!"
19412,10088,2001-12-13,5,Extremely easy and very good.  I also made some and added mini marshmallows.  My kids liked that one best.
20159,3807,2001-12-29,4,I baked 1 squash at 350 F. for 45 mins.  Probably could have cooked 1 hr but had to serve dinner.  My MIL suggested cooking the squash halves upside-down (so they get evenly cooked) and adding the ingredients after the first 30 mins.  We loved the flavors!
9869,15514,2001-12-13,5,Now I know how I can use the bottle of Amaretto Ive had in the cupboard for months...this is yummy!!
15900,11107,2001-08-29,0,Wonderful!!!!!!!!!1111
20159,11107,2001-11-25,5,My teenage kids loved it as well as my husband - the best.  I increased the amount of water used and only used 1/2 stick of butter total.  The sauce was still great.  MMMM!!
11674,10104,2001-07-11,0,Now that I have made this several times I would double the ingredients for the marinade to make the final sauce more flavorful.
11297,10104,2001-07-16,4,Really great. Sometimes I also add some thinly sliced carrot. The orange & green look really good together.  I serve over boiled rice.  Cheers :)
6584,6640,2001-03-29,4,very good ! took some to mom & dad and they want more.
23395,4468,2001-11-12,0,"This sounds yummie, but I'd be interested in how you serve this.

Also, there are some ingredients in the directions that are missing from the ingredient list.  It says to stir in the cane syrup and green onions, but they are not listed as ingredients.

Also, in would help to note somewhere that the sweet potatoes need to be cooked.
Some folks may not know how to make a roux so that information would be helpful also."
25267,14897,2001-12-04,5,Melted in my mouth.
6357,14925,2001-12-11,4,"Nice cake. I baked this this evening. Its nice, but my guests said that the eggs were a little too much. I guess 3 eggs will be good enough.
I used raspberry jam for this."
21487,15692,2001-12-14,5,I haven't tried this exact recipe yet however anything with garlic wins top billing with me. I have however created this almost exactly in a cold version but included red wine vinegar.
21694,13303,2001-11-03,5,Absolutly heavenly!  I love the feta!
5049,4368,2001-01-29,3,"This was easy to make, but when mashing the potatoes and garlic, be sure to get the garlic mashed.  It is hard to find it in the potatoes, so you need to mash it all well.  The taste is subtle, but true.  You may want to add a little more butter and salt."
11306,4368,2001-06-18,5,realy nice
20754,4368,2001-11-23,5,I thought this recipe was great!  I did change it a little though.  Instead of garlic cloves I used minced garlic run though my processer before adding to the potatoes.  It was delicious!  I did add more salt and pepper.
18660,10490,2001-10-09,5,"My family loved this recipe.  The recipe makes ample sauce which has a sweet and sour taste. We served the chicken over white rice and the sauce added flavor to the rice also. Try this recipe, it's a nice dish to serve to guests also."
22397,9970,2001-10-31,4,I thought this was a decent recipe.  I would use more spices to liven things up a bit and I omitted the cheddar cheese from the mix.  It seemed a bit too velveta-ish with all those cheeses mixed together.  I substituted some freshly grated Romano instead and the taste was great.  Thanks
24923,9970,2001-12-10,5,"This was a great recipe. I made a healthier version using 50 % less fat sausage and low fat cheeses. Next time I will make this with ground turkey sausage, to cut the fat even more. Very tasty and filling. Made the whole recipe and froze half of it for a no prep second meal. For 2 people it was 4 meals."
4470,3057,2001-09-04,5,I had them with vanilla yogurt and they were great. I also served them with a pork roast Thanks Bergy
16666,8938,2001-09-06,5,When we were in Iran (5 years) we would make this with lentel beans. Yogurt with onion and cummbers. Alot of fresh sliced veg.
21730,8462,2001-10-23,5,Delicious. I substitued onions with shallots and add some cellery.
20920,8260,2001-10-10,5,"this dish was very simple and quick to make,and used hardly any ingredients. i did however change the garlic powder to chopped garlic and it worked a treat. i served the lamb korabiak with baby carrots that had been steamed in the oven in foil in plenty of sugar, salt, pepper and mixed herbs and the whole dish was absoloutly delicious, the best iv`e tasted in a long time!"
11543,8260,2001-11-18,5,I used fresh garlic.  I served the chops with a greek salad and rice and tzatziki sauce.  An outstanding meal.
25115,15280,2001-12-26,5,Delicious!! Made it for Christmas dinner and this was everyone's favorite.  Very flavorful.  Recieved a lot of complements on this one.
9468,8596,2001-05-16,3,"It was not quite like the Olive Garden. It was very liquid, while their's seems to be thicker. I may try adding more parmesan while it is cooking. The parmesan didn't melt in very well."
10864,8596,2001-06-20,3,"I enjoyed this dish very much.  My husband used to work for the olive garden, so he knows the alfredo sauce when he tastes it.  I used preshreaded parmesan cheeze and put it in just before i took it off the heat and it melted fine.  i also used just a touch more cream cheeze so it wouldn't be too thin which worked.  personally i thought it had too much of a cream taste.  i may next time try a little buttermilk.  
Good recipe, but it needs a little tweeking if you ask me."
21019,8596,2001-10-18,5,"If you change the t table spoons cream cheese to 8 ounce pack of cream cheese its better the Olive Gardens. Also if you are adding sea food such as Crab meat, shrimp, or Samon I think 2 oz. for clam juice would round out this dish.  Its so good I put it on our menu once a week and sell out each time."
12790,9767,2001-07-18,5,"Alright - I'm notoriously a bad cook.  My previous menu mostly included cereal with milk and take-out.

Call me crazy, but I got ambitious a little bit ago, and decided I was going to cook up a meal for a date.

It must have been divine intervention, because for some reason I actually chose this intimidating recipe.

Well - hallelujah! Amazingly it turned out fantastic!
I even impressed my gourmet chef boss with the left-overs.

I am very impressed with this one.

Thanks!

I'm serving it tonite for a dinner date - also including rice and maybe some bread - most likely bisquits and honey (ok - so I'm no gourmet).
I think this also goes well with a semi-dry white wine.
"
21694,14245,2001-11-20,5,I had this for lunch and it was great.  I substituted the brown rice for wild rice though.
6014,3238,2001-02-22,3,"This recipe was delicious, but took a lot of time, cost and effort to make."
20832,8650,2001-10-09,5,"Spicy, zingy, bold, yet full of subtle nuance. Incredibly simple to make, and a little goes a LONG way. I tried it with home grown basil on bowties with some diced sundried tomatos, and YUMMMMM.... Lovely color as well!"
6357,8961,2001-05-29,0,"The lovely colours of this cake tempt your eyes...and melt your heart...and make your mouth water, just to have a bite and then have another one and then one more...endlessly!!"

For all you dummies (like me) out there, Step 3 is a little ambiguous, but it's VERY IMPORTANT to pour the egg mixture INTO the bacon grease, as instructed. The egg is what thickens it up, so if it doesn't cook, you get a watery potato salad. Add a little heat if you need it I'm going to try this one again to see if I can get it right.

It was good anyway, watery or not, although quite a bit sweeter then I expected!

A pinch of cayenne was not enough for my taste...I cound't actually taste it at all. I'm going to push it up to 1/8 tsp next time (with halfs on everything to get 6 servings instead of 12), and maybe add some paprika just for kicks.

Ate this with some grilled ribeye steaks and a cold hoppy English-style ale...Yummm!

I'll post a followup to let you know how it went."
24942,11923,2001-11-29,5,I think this recipe is going to be good. I am an American and never have eaten German food. I hanv to do a project on Germany so I decided to make this dish. It sounds great.
6143,5465,2001-02-28,5,"Substituted whole grain bread.  Used organic banana, natural (unhydrogenated) peanut butter.  I saved time, utensils and steps by mashing the banana on the bread.  So it took me less than 5 minutes to prepare.  Easy.  1 skillet, 1 knife, 1 paper plate.  Delicious, it was.  And very nutritious.  The sauteeing took the dryness out of this popular sandwich.  Would I serve it to guests?  To the young at heart, yes.  And the heating of the banana gave it a decided Deep-South flavor, almost exotic."
26696,4075,2001-12-20,5,My husband took some to work and everyone wanted the recipe.  Easy recipe and worth the little bit of time.
23293,13937,2001-11-10,5,very easy to make  my family enjoyed it.
19013,9027,2001-11-01,5,Very easy and tasty.  Adding a little soy sauce gives a little extra kick.
27614,16463,2001-12-31,0,"Too complicated to even attempt.  Plus, there were ingredients I have never used and probably would not use again. Otherwise, it would probably be a tasty drink. Plus, the drink was lacking nutritinally compared to some of the other similar recipes I saw on this site.  Sorry!"

5802,2941,2001-02-12,5,I used this recipe for a baby shower and it was the talk of the party.  It's sooo easy and absolutely wonderful!!!
10099,2941,2001-05-24,4,"I served this at a christening party I gave for a friend this past weekend and it was a hit. However, I think next time I make it I will decrease the amount of sherbert by 1/2 to decrease sweetness and play with it from there.  All the guests liked it though, and several asked for the recipe."
10306,2941,2001-05-29,5,"I made this punch for a bridal shower. It was really easy to make and everyone loved it. They kept going back for more! I added frozen raspberries to help keep the punch cool. It added a nice, decorative touch and by the time we got around to drinking it, the raspberries had thawed enough to where they were edible. I will be using this recipe for any future showers or parties."
16549,2941,2001-08-29,5,I also used this recipe for a bridal shower.  Everyone loved it.  Several of the guests wanted to have the recipe.  It was perfect for the warm sumnmer afternoon.  I did find it very quick to make.  I also added the frozen raspberries.  I was extremely pleased with the results. Thank you.
12875,10301,2001-08-05,5,"I HATE GUACAMOLE!  I have NEVER tasted guacamole that I liked.  But, I loved this recipe it was delicious.  My husband loves guacamole and I made this recipe for him.  He loved it and I loved it."
13483,9919,2001-09-04,4,This was so easy to make.  It sure beats the bought stuff.  I used a bit more garlic and everyone seemed to like it.  Thanks for the recipe
6357,10616,2001-09-10,4,"Great on a terribly hot summer afternoon, goes well with Vegetarian Biryani and even with a spicy curry!"
13712,210,2001-08-05,5,"This is the best punch to have at any party.  It tastes so good, that another two batches had to be made.  In fact, it's so easy to make, anyone can make it at any time."
4353,4832,2001-01-05,3,"This is only a low sodium recipe if you completely omit the salt - just use a little more pepper, or some garlic powder."

10332,9313,2001-09-20,0,Nasty
11291,5347,2001-06-26,2,I did like the recipe but not my husband unfortunately. He couldn't put his finger on it but I think that the main problem was missing sauce and the consistency of the whole casserole.
7802,12174,2001-10-24,4,Good recipe for winter when you can't get to the grill. The sauce is quite tasty and the meat comes out very tender.
20214,12174,2001-11-12,4,"This recipe is very good.  I didn't have the honey
mustard, so I used liquid honey and djon mustard.  I also added 1 cup of hickory Kraft BBQ sauce, just to give the sauce another dimension.
I also took the ribs out of the sauce, and baked them on a baking sheet for another 1/2 hour in a 300 degree oven.  This way, they are more like ribs from the grill.  Very yumppy......  Enjoy."

22242,2537,2001-10-28,5,I am always trying to find a better apple pie. This one is a definite plus in my book and company enjoyed it served warm with cinnammon ice cream which I made by softening 1/2 gallon of vanilla and blending in cinnamon to taste. Then refreeze it and serve with pie.
24923,13784,2001-11-29,3,"I needed something healthy and quick with chicken. The basil made a big difference in the taste. I also added shredded low fat cheese. I will make this agin, and maybe add some diced onion for flavor and diced red pepper for color."

20076,10075,2001-11-25,2,"I made these for Thanksgiving.  While they did smell great, they didn't go over that well.  I followed the instructions to a ""T"" and the one thing I disliked, it nearly ruined my glass baking dish.  Took 2 days to get it clean, probably from the vinegar, who knows."

5060,12244,2001-10-03,4,"Very good, thank-you, my husband thought it was what he calls ""sneaky hot"",he enjoyed it and wants it again. My mouth is still tingley. 
Used skinless, legs.
The only problem I had was after the first 6 minutes I took the chicken out to turn it over and the sauce had heavily congealed, so I spooned it into a cup and poured 3 or 4 more tablespoons of sherry in and whisked it up, put the chicken back in and poured the thinned sauce over it. When it was done, (8 minutes) the sauce had thickened again and coated the chicken nicely, without adding any more cornstarch. It will be a repeat. Looking forward to cold left overs.

22412,13255,2001-10-29,5,"for those wondering about the ginger biscuits, the equivalent - gingersnap cookies!!
this recipe is easy to make and delicious."
6976,2903,2001-03-24,4,This dish was prepared and plated in about 45 minutes (including prep time) and was very easy to make.  We made the dish just as the recipe read with no substitutions.  For the ground red pepper we used cayenne (go very light lest it be too hot).  I will admit that we bumped the amount of garlic up a bit to about 3 cloves chopped.
10314,2903,2001-09-13,5,This recipe was REALLY quick and easy.  It tasted wonderful.  The peppers gave it an almost sweet flavor.  Very different from conventional fish recipes.  I will be making this again very soon.
5523,2713,2001-02-01,4,Good one even for cold nights in Toronto.

22059,9280,2001-10-25,5,"The cake was delicious . . . only I added raisins and coconut into the cake batter and only had to cook it for 30 minutes.  I also bought my own icing and when I toasted the coconut, I also put walnuts on top.  Great cake!  Everyone loved it."

21453,8739,2001-10-17,5,VERY GOOD we loved it. When I have leftover Guacamole I put one of the pits in the center of the dip and it stays fresh longer.
20893,8739,2001-10-19,5,I have never made guacamole before because I am the only one in my family that eats it but your recipe looked so fresh and easy I had to try it!  It was absolutely wonderful!!  I used Roma tomatoes and added the cilantro with a fresh jalepeno pepper! I shared it with some friends and we all loved it!! I went to the store for more avacodos to make it again! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

6164,1878,2001-03-01,0,"Here is one more way of doing this and the same can also be used as an excellent 
accompaniment to any dish. 
Dice nearly 10-12 medium sized onions and keep aside. 
Take a half litre yoghurt container. 
Add half teaspoon salt and half teaspoon coriander powder to the same. 
Mix the ingredients well to get a smooth consistency. 
Now put the onions in this curd mixture.
Chop a bunch of green coriander leaves or parsley and add to this.
Leave it aside for 45 minutes for the flavours to set in.
Salt can be adjusted to individual preferences.
Enjoy with steamed rice, sandwiches, hot pita bread or even with pastas. 
This also goes well as a dip with fritters.

Hope you enjoy the same.

10808,1878,2001-06-11,3,"This is one of our family favourite ""onion"" chutneys which goes well only with tomato pilaf or coconut rice. It is also known as ""Hellflame""
or ""Devil Chutney""

1 medium onion
1 tsp  chillie powder
2 tsps  sugar
pinch  salt
1 tabsp lemon juice

In a liquidiser grind all ingredients to a smooth sauce. If too sweet adjust by adding more chillie powder. If too hot, add a bit more sugar. How easy  is that!
Another version of the above is to use only 1 tsp sugar and add 2 tsps sultanas. This makes it a thicker and darker sauce. Enjoy!

8971,8880,2001-05-02,5,"This recipe is great for a different appetizer or first course whatever your diet. You can easily eliminate butter to cut a few fat calories, but it's worth the splurge. Love to dip leaves into resulting broth. Artichokes are most tender cooked this way. After the prep work is completed, there's little to do. I didn't remove choke - but that's a nice touch. I would love to try several different herbs to augment the parsley. Great recipe for family or dinner party."
14613,8880,2001-10-11,5,this is great.  a perfect sauce for dipping the leaves in.
20268,8880,2001-10-17,5,I will never boil artichokes again. This to me is the only way to eat an artichoke without loosing the potent nutritional value it holds. The wine is an essential ingredient in this recipe.

3861,3439,2001-01-02,4,"This really is a great recipe. I substitute Chicken Broth for the water and at the end I add some cream (Heavy, Light or Half & Half) just to add some creamy richness. Also for a special twist add some cooked baby shrimp (peeled & de-viened of course) 15-20 minutes before serving. And plenty of cracked Pepper and Soda Crackers :-) Enjoy."
20759,3439,2001-10-08,5,"I used the suggestion of Bob LeBlanc and it was wonderful.  I found out that half way
through the cooking process, I needed to add more water (or broth) I added a 1 1/2 cups more.
At the last 20 minutes of cooking I added a cup of 1/2 and 1/2 (we use the fat free one).

The recipe made about 16 cups of soup.  It only took 20 minutes to fry bacon, then the potato

12875,9546,2001-10-22,5,This was very good.  I made a cheese sauce to go on top.  First I made a roue of 2 T crisco melted in a pan then added about 1 T of flour stirred in real good so there were no lumps.  I browned it slightly and added about 1-2 c. of milk.  This I thickened and added some velveeta cheese about1/2 of a big log.  Then I added about 1 c Rotel tomatoes.  Stir until cheese is melted.  Youn may add salt and pepper if you like.  Add this on top of the chimichangas.  Delicious.  (these measurement are approx.) You could also put chili on top.  I also added about 1 c. of cheddar cheese to my refried beans and some milk to make it creamy
19008,10203,2001-09-23,5,"very easy and very good! Made it ahead of time and put it in a crock pot. I really like this recipe because you can add ingredients to taste!

8629,8694,2001-04-22,2,"I tried this recipe because it was the first small quantity baked bean recipe I've found.  It's a good starter recipe but I think it could be doctored up just a little by adding onions. Also, the recipe doesn't state how much water the beans should be soaked in and then cooked in. I cooked them (meaning in boiling water) for well over the stated 15 minutes and the beans were still not tender."
16673,29062,2001-08-29,5,I used a Creamy Herb Sauce with mine and served it with pasta.  It makes a nice change from tomatoe based pasta dishes.
6512,29062,2001-10-08,5,"Instead of cooking onion(I substituted white onions) and mushrooms in water, I sauteed in butter til tender. I increased mushrooms to an 8oz container and used 8 oz of cheese. Very tasty. I'd call this a meatless lasagna. I think this will become a family favorite.  (Prep time was approximately 45 minues. It could be shortened if you fry eggplant in 2 pans instead of waiting to use the one.)"

20371,11420,2001-10-30,5,"I cut this recipe in half (using 3 tbsp honey) and baked it in an 8"" cake pan as a side-dish with tonight's dinner. This is by far the moistest cornbread I have ever made. It was easy, quick to whip together, and was wonderful. It's a definite keeper!"
21730,15955,2001-12-19,3,"I have a similar recipe.

4470,324,2001-07-02,5,Excellent recipe!  I couldn't find any muenster cheese so I used aged gouda and it was very tasty.

12657,7919,2001-09-16,4,"Very flavourful recipe, though the amount of butter seems to be a little excess. I added a dash of basil to enhance the taste."
7802,9508,2001-09-04,4,"This is the first pound cake I ever made. Didn't come out as moist as I'd hoped, but it was probably overcooked a bit. Also, I used fresh key limes since I couldn't find Floriddean brand (or any other brand) key lime juice."
2312,13184,2001-12-26,5,"A neighbor brought these to a cookie exchange and they were delicious.  Her words ""It's Martha, it's a lot of work, but sometimes it's worth it.""  I was so excited to see that we had the recipe on Recipezaar.  She was exactly right.  These are the perfect coffee or dessert cookie for the holidays.  Just the right mix of chocolate and gingerbread.  The only thing we changed was to dust the cookies in superfine sugar instead of granulated sugar.  The finer sugar makes the cookies just sparkle mysteriously, instead of looking like they were dusted in sugar.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
4043,2897,2001-01-05,5,It was totally tasty dudes
5714,2897,2001-02-12,5,It was delicious. And very easy too. Even a little kid could make it.
5724,2897,2001-02-12,5,It was DELICIOUS and so easy too. My six year old niece even made it herself. It is such a healthy snack.
10962,2897,2001-06-12,0,"It's pretty darn good.  My friend, Tayler (10) and I (11) made this as a desert at a sleepover.  It's great!"
6512,5253,2001-10-15,5,Easy and Yummy. I doubled the flour and  spices. After coating the chicken I browned in oil on top of the stove. I added the left over flour and spices to the broth.  I also added a can of Rotel tomatos with chili's.I cooked in a ceramic casserole dish with a lid at 450 for same amount of time. Chicken was so tender it fell off the  bone.
6303,3779,2001-03-07,1,You can tell he or she has never worked as a chef.  Just because you come from philly doesn't make you an expert
20576,3779,2001-10-06,2,"I used a smoked roast and added sauteed garlic and, of course, red and green peppers, some more spice like chipotle powder, cumin, and white pepper to the recipe and everyone loved it.  As is, this recipes is lacking, though."
16676,14511,2001-11-21,5,this dip is the greatest you woould ever eat..really a great dip..you have to try it really fantastic...
25851,8118,2001-12-10,5,"Didn't pay attention to the time, but I know for a fact that it took about 1 hour to get everything done before putting it in the oven, but it was worth it!!!  Tasted just like KaseKuchen.  I even had guests asking for the recipe.  A great hit!!!"
2312,10051,2001-09-23,4,Easy to make and light and somewhat flaky.  I just think that the shortening is a little lacking in flavor and burned a little too easily.  Next time I might try half butter and half shortening.
5523,8697,2001-05-24,3,Try Frying your potatoes and adding boiled eggs cut in four.Mix well in a bowl and serve.
21641,13674,2001-11-12,4,Quick to fix and really good. A real kid pleaser. We added more garlic and a can of drained rotel diced tomatoes to ours for a little extra kick. Thanks:)
6357,3043,2001-12-25,3,"Nice crunchy one. 
I omitted the sweet n low."
15242,9793,2001-08-21,5,"I made the recipe, however, I added Mixed Pickling Spices, tied in a 
Cheesecloth, and let it marinate over night after boiling for 15 minutes.
I also added the ginger root inside the Cheesecloth.  I am entering it in
the State Fair. Wish me luck!"
17050,9793,2001-08-30,5,My Mother used to make tomato preserves from a recipe she got from her Mother. I have used their recipe successfully. The quantities were the same but it did not require pectin. They also added a broken cinnamon stick. I always found this delightful. I can recall having it on toast for breakfast and sucking on the piece of cinnamon stick as I walked to school in the morning.
23913,16343,2001-12-31,4,I made this tonight for something quick easy and different it was very good and very easy to make thanks
20160,8798,2001-12-31,5,"This was really good.
I used 2 - 700ml jars of Classico Florentine Spinach and Cheese Spaghetti Sauce.  And I was really lazy and used dry basil.  I will definatley make this again. I think I will try Healthy Choice Chunky Lovers Italian Stlye Vegetable Sauce next time - it's fat free."
7673,3877,2001-04-18,5,I substituted 3 bananas instead of zucchini and it was very yummy!
15645,3877,2001-10-20,5,Works just as great as muffins!
27532,13037,2001-12-31,5,"It's excellent but the for first timer, they need to specify how many breads you can get for this amount of dough. If these help in anyway I did six"
14836,8480,2001-08-15,4,"I would have liked to make this recipe, but it requires a rice cooker. Unfortunately this eliminates anyone who doesn''t have this specialized piece of equipment."
21738,8480,2001-10-22,0,"forget the rice cooker..walmart sells a microwave rice cooker (with locking lid) for about $7.00 and it is MUST HAVE...i cook all my rice and alot more in it....this is a great recipe for that cooker....25minutes and your ready to eat....
angela"
21656,15851,2001-12-23,4,Made these tonight. I didn't put in the coconut flakes but used chocolate chips instead. They are a crisp cookie. Great for dunking in tea. I think next time I make them I will use 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter to give them a softer texture. I liked them. :)
2312,8674,2001-09-26,5,"Easy and yummy.  Didn't have ground beef, so used a little cut up cooked pork, but concluded they would have been just as good without.  Did end up putting some sesame oil, soy sauce and ground ginger in the mix for more flavor.  Who would have thought that making your own egg rolls could be so easy."
11882,8674,2001-08-21,5,These were super and real easy to make. Will make them again sometime.
18977,8674,2001-09-23,4,"The Egg Rolls, or as my family calls them..Spring Rolls are made in very much the same way.
But...I place the cabbage in a pot of salted, boiling water and let simmer for about 5 minutes.
Drain and let cool.  Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the cabbage as you can with your hands. This softens the cabbage and makes the egg rolls much easier to eat.
I also add thinly sliced shittaki mushrooms to the ground beef mixture, along with approximately 1 tsp. salt. Also I've found using white pepper rather than black gives more of a ""Chinese flavor"". For the dipping sauce, try adding Chinese Hot Mustard to soy sauce.  Hmmmmm good!!!"
15609,8674,2001-09-26,4,These are good.  I also add the La Choy veggies and a little ginger.  Mmmmmm Mmmmmmm.
20832,8674,2001-10-09,5,"Can I come over to your house?? Man, everything you've submitted so far is STELLAR!!! Where did you learn to cook? These egg rolls have great color, texture, taste, and they are easy (albeit a bit messy) to make! You need lots of counter space for this one, but it's worth it! Try it with teryaki wings!!!"
19043,8674,2001-11-14,4,"These were great, and very easy.  I used shrimp and added a little onion and ginger.  You were correct about the need for almost ""over seasoning"".  I thought I had ruined the dish but cooked them anyway and they were great.  Thanks!"
9225,4765,2001-05-10,5,"This is a great alternative for french fries.  My kids are asking me for the new kind of ""French Fries"".  They are tasty enough that you don't need katup."
5974,67,2001-02-20,5,"This pound cake makes a great base for Strawberry shortcake.
The recipe does NOT half well, however it does freeze well and handy to have on hand for a quick dessert.
Use quality bourbon for the best taste.  I recommend Labrot & Graham's Woodford Reserve if you want to keep a very fine bourbon on hand for cooking, baking and drinking.  ;-)"
4470,13204,2001-11-18,0,"This year instead of 3 tbs ""Jack Daniels"" I put in 6 tbs and just had to leave the mixture sit in the fridge for 1 1/2 hrs to firm instead of 45 min.  The mixture should be at the stage where it will sit in a nice mound. I also made them smaller and got 3 dozen.  Hope someones tries these they are good!"
9869,13204,2001-12-12,5,"These are the best! I used a different whiskey and they are now in the freezer, well minus 2 or 3 that is  =)"
9869,13098,2001-12-25,5,"This always looks so pretty, a definite favourite.
Simple to prepare and love the crunch of the ingredients. Thanks for posting."
2695,350,2001-01-19,1,This recipe needs a little help !
5898,350,2001-02-28,0,"To David Cansler,  I would like your recipe please.  June Bug"
25808,350,2001-12-10,0,I use 2/3 cup water instead of milk...they turn out great.
22278,13474,2001-11-01,0,*****
9121,13474,2001-11-12,5,Absolutely delicious.  I used Veganaise mayonnaise to make this truly vegan and substituted garlic baby dills for the sweets.
12491,9240,2001-07-30,5,This dessert is very easy to make and tastes GREAT!!!
4453,9240,2001-08-15,5,"I've made this desert for years.
It is better with French Vanilla Pudding.
Even better the next day."
12481,9240,2001-09-05,5,This dessert was very easy to make and was a hit with my family. I used Chocolate Fudge frosting and it looked just like the dark chocolate you find on eclairs and tasted great.
15609,9240,2001-09-26,4,"I crushed some of the graham crackers, mixed with some butter, pressed in the bottom and up the sides of my pan and baked for a few minutes to make a ""crust"".  Then I followed the directions. Oops, I forgot, I also used the crushed gr. crackers to ""fill in"" the little gaps around the edges and in between on the graham cracker layer."
13483,9240,2001-10-20,5,"Can't say much more than others have, but this is really terrific.  Easy do ahead dessert with a taste that can't be beat.  Thank you for posting this.  It will be used many times."
20159,9240,2001-12-03,4,I also used graham cracker crumbs/butter as a crust rather than the actual graham crackers.  Used banana cream instant pudding instead of vanilla...very good.
10751,8313,2001-06-11,4,My family LOVES fennel so I thought we should give this one a go. IT WAS GREAT!!! A family fave now. Danielle Rigby - Australia
21656,14927,2001-12-05,5,"This was sooooo good! 
I had to alter it a bit because I didn't have some of the ingredients. I used Red Pepper & Basil mustard and cream of mushroom soup. It
turned out great! The pork chops were very tender.
I'll definately make this again! Thanks :)"
26314,14927,2001-12-18,5,This was a terrific recipe and so easy to make!  It made excellent gravy for both the potatoes and the pork.  The pork chops were fork tender and absolutely delicious!.  Thanks for posting.
26491,14927,2001-12-19,5,This was an excellent recipie.  It was a geat way to come home to a terrific meal after work.  My husband and I both loved it!
23027,14927,2001-12-31,5,"This turned out great with almost no effort. I used cream of mushroom soup because I didn't have cream of chicken. Also, next time I don't think I'll brown the pork chops first. Since they stay in the crockpot so long, they will get done in there and I will have eliminated some of the fat. Great recipe."
17156,9413,2001-08-31,4,"I've cooked Bell Peppers in the crockpot before and have always burned the bottoms and sides.

Thanks for giving me a solution to at least half that problem!  

Put the tops of the pepper in the bottom of the pot and the stuffed peppers on top of the tops!

Thanks!"
21725,15431,2001-12-15,5,Easy! Fun and FAST!
20214,15431,2001-12-16,3,"Quite good, and this is a great recipe
when the kids just ""need"" to help you bake!
Fast and easy for sure!  Enjoy......."
22001,15431,2001-12-28,5,I made these for the any children coming for the christmas holiday but all the adults loved them as well.  I added chocolate to it as well
27454,16344,2001-12-31,3,This was a good basic recipe.
5199,8515,2001-01-19,1,I think this was the most awfulest punch I have ever tasted hope someone else has better luck!!!!!
6908,8515,2001-03-24,4,"VERY good, if you like spiced punch. Everyone I gave it to loved it. I used Big K Lemon-Lime Soda. I don't know about Karen's results... maybe too much salt and pepper? or cinnamon?"
12250,1320,2001-07-10,5,I did not have soy sauce so I used teriyaki sauce and this was wonderful!  I used it on a steak I later grilled and then on chicken breasts I panfried.  Both tasted great!
20554,4397,2001-11-02,5,"I got this recipe years ago from a friend.  It is awesome.  Don't let the strange combination of ingredients throw you off.  Everytime I make it, it gets devoured.  I serve it with tortilla chips or crackers."
6702,14396,2001-12-07,4,"Very very good recipe. Next time though, I think that I will pound the breasts down a bit to give more surface area for the coating. Also, despite the sodium in the ranch mix, I found that the chicken needed some salt. Maybe that would be a bit different though if I used thinner breasts.
Try using the leftover mix on potatoes with a bit of oil and roast with the chicken. Yum!"
6357,10455,2001-07-28,5,"WOW! Its lovely, so tasty! Thank you for sharing it!!!"
19799,10455,2001-10-16,5,"Very easy to make,good flavor and texture."
21618,12829,2001-10-20,5,Very Impressive!
10864,3866,2001-06-14,5,WOW what a great recipe!!  I served it to my family and even those who didn''t like squash loved it!!  Thanks so much for the great recipe!!
12619,3866,2001-07-16,4,My family and I really enjoyed this dish. But next time I will have less bread crumbs on top. I did add one chopped green bell pepper to it. Which was great.
14059,3866,2001-08-10,2,"Um... Maybe it's just me, but I'm not a big fan of the squash. I've tried Yukon Gold Potatoes in something similar with good results. I think either good fresh corn or eggplant (substitute mozerella or swiss for the cheddar) would work in equivelant amounts."
6357,9950,2001-11-25,1,"Will never forget this bread. I lost my most favourite mixing dish because of this recipe.
I'd loved your ""Apple bread"" and thought this would be just as tasty as that, but, you've gone wrong with the measurement of the quantity of milk this recipe needs. Unfortunately, I can't tell you exactly how much to use of it, because, in order to have a smooth batter, you need alot more than 1 cup milk. This was the recipe that led to a kitchen disaster..."
8836,3065,2001-09-27,4,"Although this is a basic baked fish recipe, I found it to be quite yummy.  I had never tried orange roughy until I made this recipe...someone gave me a few pieces, so I decided to see what recipes I could find for it.  I used mozzarella cheese instead and added fresh lemon juice also.  Quick prep and cook times also, 15 minutes tops!"
13504,24533,2001-08-29,4,Relish is excellent and very colorful.  One batch makes about double the stated amount in recipe.  I would highly recommend this recipe!
4276,8468,2001-01-08,0,This dish has been in homes across the south for as long as I can remember. Sometimes a little onion is added to the mixture. Goes great with any meal.
8229,8468,2001-04-13,4,"Great salad!!!! It reminds me of home. I lived in Driebergen uptil February this year, so I am curious which restaurant you have been eating?
Thank you for a taste from home. Martina"
5999,8468,2001-06-16,5,I added sliced sweet onions and relived a dish from my grandmother's table.  Truly wonderful!
4470,8468,2001-08-01,5,I grew up with this side dish and serve it often. It is very Danish too
13758,8468,2001-08-05,0,I have added sesame oil and cilanro to this receipe
14059,8468,2001-08-10,4,"And here, I thought this recipe was dead. Now you serve that with some good ripe beefsteak or creole tomatoes on the side with just a touch of salt on ''em... yum"
15064,8468,2001-08-15,0,"Haven't made it yet, but add paprika and it sounds like my former father-in-law's Hungarian cucumber salad."
15970,8468,2001-08-21,5,With the addition of onion and cracked black pepper I was taken back to my childhood in Kansas.
16346,8468,2001-08-23,4,I always include onions! I also usually add some dill--fresh or dried.
13670,8468,2001-10-24,5,"Delicious. For a variation, I used two English cucumbers instead of 3 regular cucumbers, and seasoned rice vinegar."
18660,8468,2001-11-05,4,I loved these cucumbers! I ate a dish similar to this at a Korean restaurant. The dish is very versatile and will go with anything. I can see why so many people enjoy it! They have a unique sweet and sour tang.
20084,8468,2001-11-06,5,Easy and yummy!
20371,8468,2001-11-08,5,Absolutely wonderful! Made it last night to serve with dinner tonight and my MIL was thrilled; said she hadn't had it in years. I too used an English cucumber and rice vinegar. This is about the easiest side dish you can serve! Next time I will definitely add onion.
23469,8468,2001-11-12,5,My Mom always made this and I love it. She added a little onion and olive oil.I make it often when we have a lot of cucumbers in the garden.
2525,8468,2001-11-29,0,I''m really happy to read so many people are enjoying my Mothers recipe for cucumber salad. She would be absolutely thrilled. Thanks you so much. ENJOY.
13593,9144,2001-11-12,5,This soup is really creamy and hearty.  Another keeper to add to my collection.  Thank you for sharing.
21752,7788,2001-10-28,4,"This is very similar to something I've been making for years, although the added ginger is a nice touch."
5689,1232,2001-02-12,1,...
23698,2665,2001-11-15,5,What a hit!
20591,2075,2001-12-07,5,"This is what I consider my ""find"" of the year. It is the most awesome bread, sliced thin with cream cheese then chilled.Wonderful!! You just have to trust the recipe, it sure seems like it couldn't work but it does. Who ever heard of eating the orange; peel and all?"
6389,8608,2001-03-12,4,best recipe iv tried in a long time.
4287,5208,2001-01-02,5,This is the recipe I have used for many years.  It is so yummy.  It is easy to make and a treat to eat.  It is good for every day type bread and wonderful to give as a gift.  It is a favorite of my family.
21694,10594,2001-10-30,5,You weren't kidding about it being a comfort food.  It was fantastic.
25330,10594,2001-12-04,5,I just made this recipe for my family and they loved it. Even my finicky teenage son came back for seconds. It was easy to make and so satisfying. Thankyou for this recipe.
21618,12824,2001-10-20,5,Very Impressive!
14917,2189,2001-08-21,5,This recipe was much quicker than any other fudge I've made...and I've made a lot! It was easy to make and simply marvellous to eat!
21752,12648,2001-11-25,5,"I mixed up my first batch this past Friday morning, using non-dairy soy milk powder, and by Friday afternoon had already used up most of it for my weekend baking.  It works beautifully!"
15385,13680,2001-11-05,5,"This is so simple and so good..... I made it for lunch and did'nt get enough,everyone wanted another bowl.  It is worth it"
16758,10287,2001-12-27,4,"very tastey soup,when i made this i had no garlic cloves so i use 1 tsp garlic salt, instaed of mushroom,i used can corn. i like it"
2312,14090,2001-12-26,5,"This would be a beautiful special occasion dinner, but tenderloins were on sale, so we had it on a week night.  This recipe is so easy and quick it makes an ordinary Tuesday seem special.  I loved the food and the combination of flavors.  The only thing that I seemed to do wrong was the fruit sauce did not have enough liquid to it by the time I added it to the dish, so some of the fruit got a little crispy.  Next time I will add a cup or two of water or apple juice to the fruit/brandy to make a more substantial sauce.  Also I managed to cook the whole thing in a cast iron skillet that I browned the meat in and then went straight into the oven -- convenient."
6357,11749,2001-10-16,5,Very tasty. Thank you for sharing it.
2595,4636,2001-10-05,4,This sounds very good and good for you also.
6702,10870,2001-10-01,5,"Recipe was simple and quite delicious. The whole family loved it, well, except the four year old, but she doesn't like anything really. :: laugh :::
I didn't have a lot of time to marinate the chicken, so I cut it into cubes to marinade and pan fried it. If you want to use the leftover marinade as a sauce, either use less soy, or put something else in it to take the saltiness out. The chicken was WONDERFUL, but the marinade a bit salty when used as a sauce. I still give this five stars because the marinade wasn't meant to be a sauce in the first place :: smile ::::"
19717,10870,2001-11-13,4,"Tastes great, and pretty simple too.  Be careful not to overcook it, though, if you end up cutting the chicken into small chunks.  In that case 30-45 minutes should be fine.  Keep checking!"
21694,12942,2001-10-30,5,"Really great goulash, I can't wait to make it again!"
6357,9001,2001-06-11,4,Nice one! Mouth watering!!
21694,12684,2001-11-03,5,This was so good.  I think everyone should try this immediatly.  You won''t be disappointed!!!
9121,10504,2001-10-05,4,I used soy parmesan and this was quite tasty.
8377,5282,2001-10-11,0,I haven't tried this yet...the ingredients and steps appear to be daunting.
8352,8766,2001-04-18,5,good
16459,13035,2001-10-23,5,These are good! They remind me of hoe cakes my mama used to make.
2312,10977,2001-10-25,5,"I made this a few days ago and it turned out terrific.  I was sceptical of black olives, but this is a major goat cheese household ;-).  Honestly, worked great.  Didn't have the cream though, so just used a splash of milk and more potato water -- this was the first time I learned this trick and it works and keeps the fat down in the finished product.  Keeper!"
16140,10977,2001-10-28,5,"Absolutely delicious!I did,t have black olives to hand so I sunstituted pimento stuffed green ones.I,ll be making this again."
10216,13103,2001-10-23,4,This makes my teeth hurt just to think of it! sounds great and I'm sure kids will love it... really too sweet for me though
23993,5311,2001-12-20,0,"I am very disapointed with this recipe!!!  I've been looking for an eggnog cheesecake since after Thanksgiving and this is all I found.  The recipe calls for 2 packages of bakers german chocolate, but doesn't state when /where /how it's used.  THEN It mentions cookies.  WHAT KIND???  I admit I know very liitle about baking, but I am trying.  Every other recipe I took off of this site was very easy and tasty.  I wouldn't know about this one."
27050,5311,2001-12-25,4,"I loved this recipe! It took only minutes to prepare and my children (all under 12 yrs) also made one with NO difficulty.  It was a success at the party.  If you have trouble finding the chocolate for the crust, or are in a hurry, simply use the premade chocolate grahm cracker crusts...they work just as well.  Thanks again!"
20429,4394,2001-10-29,5,I made this dip this weekend for a party I had for my friends. Everybody liked it! It wasn't too hard to make and thatsgood because I can't cook too good. My mom has been helping me.
16459,4394,2001-12-27,5,We had this last night. I added some fresh cracked pepper to spice it up a bit. It is very good. I cooked it in the fondue pot instead of the oven. It worked out just fine.
22141,12921,2001-10-28,4,"Think this is a great tasting recipe, however, I think that adding some spices (i.e., chili, Tabasco, or similar) would ""spike"" it up a little more...but then I like my foods hotter and spicy flavored.....with some ""zing"" to it. So that's what I add whenever I try this recipe. It might work pretty well with fish too, as this is pretty much a mainstay item on my menu....seafood of all kinds,lake trout, bass, bluegill, catfish, etc. 
Know Cajun Chef and he's a remarkable cook...! If you were to add oven baked potato wedges, a good grouping o of salad greens, a small french roll and a glass of great wine, this would be every bit as good as what you'd eat is one of New Orleans (or anywhere's) famous restuarants...why eat out?  Home cookin' is better.....and it's prepared with love.... So, get your aprons on gals...fix your next meal with love--that's the best ingredient of all...Tator02@aol.com"
6357,13820,2001-11-08,5,"This is excellent! I made it on the stove today in my AMC cookware. It was a real delight! I had an uncle come home for lunch and he said to tell you that he loved it! I omitted the olives and cheese. I did add 2 potatoes and I fried the caulifower pieces in hot oil, drained it and then added the pieces to the capsicums. I also added jeera for seasoning. Besides that, I added a few chopped tomato pieces for additional colour. But this is  truly excellent dish, colourful and can brighten up anyone's day!! My dad, mom and brother have said a special 'THANK YOU"" to you for sharing this:)"
14478,13007,2001-10-23,0,The wife: The spaetzle is done when it rises to the top of the boiling water. This recipe has been in my famly 4 generations.
18391,12644,2001-10-29,5,i made it without the chicken and it was still great
3737,161382,2001-06-04,5,this my daughters all time favorite
4546,6812,2001-06-11,4,"I didn't have a turnup so I substituted diced rutabaga instead. I also increased the water from two cups to four.
I like this soup very much.
gabe geber"
15609,6812,2001-09-23,4,This is good.  And easy.
6357,12542,2001-10-16,5,"Oh Carol this is one of my favourites and my dad's favourite too. He will give the world to eat pakoras on a rainy day. We are just waiting for the rains to come by in December and then, I'll be very busy frying pakoras and ohhh my, my mouth is already watering!!!!

Oh Carol, try this lovely snack with a little of ajwain along with the other masalas..it is TOO GOOD!!!"
9869,10704,2001-12-03,4,"Used ground beef for these meatballs, nice flavours, thanks for posting.  =)"
7308,2783,2001-10-01,5,"I used light cream cheese, and light sour cream.  I omitted the olive oil, and topped it with mozzerella.  It made a great tasting, good consistency dip (which was fairly low-fat)."
14348,5414,2001-08-10,4,"WOW, I've never tasted eggnog before. Thanks for opening my eyes"
19803,5414,2001-11-05,5,I concur with the others: this is the best eggnog I have ever had. It is also very easy to make.  Everyone I serve it to asks for the recipe.  It was a huge hit at Christmas last year.  I use brandy in it and it is fabulous.
15346,3370,2001-08-21,5,what can i say its very easy and very gooooood. the kids loved it
21035,3370,2001-10-11,5,ITS YUM!!
19724,3370,2001-10-28,5,"Easy and delicious! I halved the ingredients since it was only for the hubby and me, used regular wheat bread and forgot the vanilla, and it was still very good! Made 10 slices using 6 eggs."
19569,11907,2001-09-23,0,well it was delicious
6357,11907,2001-09-26,5,"It was GREAT! I didn't have a sponge cake available, so used a plain cake mix and made one. In the cake, I did add 1 tspn of pineapple essence and half tspn of vanilla essence - these essences, especially the former, gave the cake a wonderful smell! Besides that, this recipe was really EXCELLENT! My parents loved it and so did I. A big ""THANK U"" to your mom from me and my family and ofcourse to U for sharing this:)"
19924,11456,2001-09-27,5,Awesome recipe for cinnamon buns...quick and easy
6357,2761,2001-06-21,5,A REAL REFRESHER! I wish I could enjoy it along with some cold strawberry juice:)
16140,2761,2001-10-22,5,"This was lovely,I added a handful of roughly chopped cashew nuts for some crunch"
15609,10239,2001-09-20,5,"I have made a recipe just like this for 25 years or so.  The only difference is I use plain ol' chips, you know like Tostito's etc.  It's almost like a Mexican Lasagne or something.  I call mine Enchilida Casserole"
22015,10239,2001-12-03,4,"This was good, but next time I think I will try the Tostito suggestion as I am not a big fan of corn chips.  However, the chips aside, it was easy and tasty."
14880,10831,2001-08-15,3,"High starch meal (obviously).  Could use a little more color, texture good.  Mild, pleasant flavor, maybe even a little bland.  Satisfying."
21295,12478,2001-10-15,5,Was very good....gave it to my mom and she prepared it......Loved the taste.....
15385,12478,2001-11-01,5,How can you stop eating this lolllllll it is so good I need to make some more.....
5523,12478,2001-11-25,0,"Lycopene, a natural antioxidant found exclusively in tomatoes, is getting much attention in the press as a cancer fighter. In the early 1990s, tomatoes and tomato-based products were spotlighted as potentially preventive. In studies conducted at Harvard, 48,000 health professionals were followed for 6 years and monitored for evidence of prostate cancer. Researchers read the results to suggest that lycopene might decrease the risk of prostate cancer, whereas other dietary antioxidants, including beta-carotene, appeared to have no effect. In an observational study in Italy, tomatoes (a diet staple) had been consumed in significantly lower quantities before their illness by patients suffering from colorectal and other digestive tract cancers than by the healthy control group.

In a study conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina, an association between heart health and tomatoes was seen. Fat samples drawn from heart attack sufferers and healthy controls were analyzed for lycopene and other carotenoids. There was significantly more lycopene in the fat of the controls than the heart patients. The diet of the controls was also higher in tomato products, suggesting that a lycopene-rich diet may have protected them against heart disease.

The method of tomato preparation seems to affect lycopene absorption. In a German study, researchers found that the lycopene blood levels were higher after ingestion of a heat-processed tomato product than after consuming uncooked tomatoes. The heat apparently disrupts the cell structure of the tomato, making the lycopene more available. Caution is indicated, however, against extracting lycopene or any compound from tomatoes and administering it separately; tomatoes are rich in vitamins, minerals, carotenoids, and other phytochemicals that may work together to exert these effects."
4867,4117,2001-01-16,5,"I have to rate this one highly, since I am the author!  I have found it quite funny to watch how this recipe has flown around the world.  

I sure wish I had done a better job of typing it out!"
20044,4117,2001-09-28,4,I'm so impressed with the cleverness of this recipe I have to comment on it before having tried it.  I'm sure it tastes wonderful too!
20702,8874,2001-10-07,4,"Finally a ""real"" Mai Tai"
5523,12720,2001-11-03,5,"One of the things i like about recipezaar.Theres allways new recipes added I,v never tried before.
This one was so easy and good at the same time. A full Tbsp of sour cream with chopped onions and garlic on top, hit the spot. Very good.7 stars for this one.;>)"
6833,8449,2001-06-20,4,The name says it all.  FAST and EASY!  Tastes good.  Makes sure you add the Aeoli.  It really enriches the flavor or the soup.  I live in a place where fish is plentiful so I have used whatever fish is available.
2312,10704,2001-09-18,5,"I omitted all the ingredients before the ground meat because I was already putting these in my spaghetti sauce, and I used ground turkey.  I still thought the meatballs were great. The recipe was easy, and baking was a nice cooking method -- simple and better for the low fat turkey.  Not sure if I'll ""die for them"" but liked them plenty. ;-)"
8000,8547,2001-06-15,5,"Excellent.  I plan to try this.
What might you substitute, if pine nuts are out of season?"
19879,8547,2001-09-26,5,"OUTSTANDING!  ... and I tried it without the pinenuts because we are on a low carb diet.
My family didn't think they liked brussel sprouts untill they tried this!   Easy too..."
10216,13043,2001-10-23,5,"Crispy cheese fingers... tasty, cheese, creamy, great with dip!!!"
25175,13043,2001-12-03,0,"While kneading, I had to add a lot more than a tablespoon or two of water. Also, you could feel a lot of oil in th mix."
21752,13043,2001-12-04,5,"These were absolutely superb, a perfect appetizer or party dish.  I added some paprika to the dough for color and flavor, and used haloumi, a Greek/Cypriot cheese that doesn't melt when fried.  It was heaven, perfect for Chanuka when fried foods are the major food on the menu!"
25656,13043,2001-12-08,5,a tasty snack not possible to eat just one.
11842,9504,2001-07-05,5,"I have been making these for 10 years. They are easy to make, refreshing and always a big hit."
13099,9504,2001-07-23,5,"Our family has enjoyed a couple of variations of this delicious summer appitizer. 
It can be made with refrigerated Pillsbury French Bread Dough, baked according 
to directions, cooled completely,and sliced into 1/4 inch pieces. We have used 
dried dill weed to sprinkle on top instead of the paprika. I prefer the spread to be 
not so firm, so I add 2T of mayonnaise to the mixture. This makes it more like a dip 
consistency, but it is easier to spread over soft bread."
24217,9504,2001-11-27,5,"Ditto to Sherry's comments, I too love this recipe, but I do prefer it with dill.  The dill/cucumber combo is just right.  A tiny splash of lemon juice doesn't hurt either."
18660,15556,2001-12-15,5,"I loved these cookies.  I made them yesterday and they are already gone.  My kids had fun making them with the cookie press.  One thing I learned though, if you're using decorative sprinkles put them on after the cookies come out of the oven or they will burn."
5328,8592,2001-03-24,5,"I just tried this recipe at our BBQ over the weekend and it was a big hit !!! 
Great recipe !!!!"
6975,8592,2001-05-21,5,wow!!
10394,8592,2001-07-02,5,"Absolutely the most delicious ribs I've ever eaten!!  Everyone raved about how good they were and wanted my recipe.  
Guess I'll have to share it with them!"
13819,8592,2001-08-06,1,"""Ribs"" be pork or beef need to be spiced or given a ""dry rub"" then slow cooked over an indirect heat ( water smoker or a gas / charcoal grill ) at 200- 220 degrees for at least 4-6 hours.  Then add sauce or a glaze for the last 30 mins."
14545,8592,2001-08-15,5,"It was easy to make, and it tasted wounderful. I have been looking for a good rib recipe for a long time, now my search is done. YUMMY!!!"
11433,8592,2001-08-24,5,i added 1/2 cup of honey to this recipe and baked them at 325 degrees for 1 1/2 hrs.  they were the best ribs i have ever eaten.  my 30 guests agreed.
10649,8592,2001-12-10,4,"I love this recipe, I tried it the other day. I agree with the first reviewer add honey its a lot better. A great base recipe though!"
21694,12843,2001-10-28,5,Absolutly great!  It was good over some rice.
4442,300,2001-01-10,4,"I made this dessert for a formal English Christmas dinner.  I did receive nothing but raves!  It was delicious and beautiful. As a matter of fact, a friend told me it was better than her friend's, who happens to be English.  I especially liked it because it did not call for a pudding mix, but rather a custard from scratch, which was as easy to make as from a box. It was not difficult to make at all.  I also added frozen berries as well as the strawberries, which seemed to only enhance the flavors."
22920,12593,2001-11-16,5,Very good!
26452,14749,2001-12-17,3,"This drink is not true ""wassail"" which is made with ale and rum, but more accurately the Danish drink known as ""Glogg"".

For best effect, don't cook the slivered almonds with the glogg, put them into the bottom of the cup, pouring the glogg over them."
23728,14749,2001-12-26,5,"I halved the recipe,   just the wonderful aroma that filled the house was worth the effort. Outstanding"
24296,4308,2001-11-23,5,veary.  veary.  fast!  and  helpful.
15572,6624,2001-10-19,3,"This was good, but a little bland.  Next time, I believe I will add a dollop of dark rum."
5088,6624,2001-12-15,5,Good recipe  I recommend using either Fuji or Granny Smith apples with this/. I wonder how a mix of both would be
6357,8638,2001-09-10,4,"Hmmm, it was great! I garnished it with Maraschino cherries and red n green glaze cherries, looked like a bride!"
4470,2650,2001-09-13,5,"What Fun! I wish you could have seen the faces on my guests faces when i sat the Chicken down on the BBQ.  I put a pan directly under the chicken to do indirect cooking in my gas BBQ and kept the pan filled with water. This does not prevent ending up with a wonderful golden chicken but it does add to keeping the hen moist.  The BBQ rub I used was ""Tony Chachere's""  WONDERFUL MOIST CHICKEN. Thankyou"
2178,15340,2001-12-17,5,"Yum! Yum!! Now this is EGG nog. It's nicely thick and deliciously creamy. And the nog is pretty nice too. We used bourbon, rather than whiskey, though. Will have to try whiskey next time."
27050,15340,2001-12-26,2,"This recipe is incomplete.  It never tells you when to combine the ingredients together.  I found it very confusing and I pride myself of making everything from scratch for over 10 years.  This stuff is POTENT as well, which may not necessarily be a bad thing. Please revise the procedure instructions and let the others know when to combine all three bowls filled.
Thank you,"
4470,15340,2001-12-27,0,I have made the requested changes to the steps and apologize if you found the recipe confusing.  I appreciate you pointing this out to me however you didn't say if you liked the eggnog or not.
9869,14424,2001-12-18,4,"Tasty dish, I used lambs fry instead of the beef.
The wine gave it a nice flavour."
16569,3841,2001-08-29,5,"This recipe was great.  The recipe was very easy to follow step to step.  The taste of the gravy was delicious.  My husband fell in love with it.  The meal was very filling, we ate eggs along with the meal & the gravy on the eggs was also good.  You only have to add salt & pepper depending on your taste & we had to add a little bit of flour for it to get thicker.  I am adding this to one of my menus for breakfast, lunch or dinner."
19799,9519,2001-12-28,4,"I added some beef base to the tomato juice to give more flavor.Was more of a stew than a casserole when done.Tasted good though,the broth was good for dipping bread."
6357,9233,2001-09-28,5,It was very tasty and I liked the colour.
16140,13168,2001-10-25,4,"Very nice,my kids loved it,the stickier the better for them!,I did how ever reduce the baking time by 3/4 hr as I used quite small drumsticks and thighs."
18745,11818,2001-11-05,5,I made two batches of these this morning and I can't believe how easy and tasty they are.  My husband is a fan of this type of peanut and I will now save money by making them myself.  Thankyou so  much for sharing.
9869,10367,2001-10-22,5,"This was great Diana.. we had the kids over for a pot luck and I made this...I used more macaroni than stated and then after your last step I put it in to an oblong dish, and sprinkled grated cheese over, then baked for approx 15 minutes.
Really popular in this household.  =)"
17803,10367,2001-11-20,3,"I made this for the second time last night. I cooked the macaroni until they were al dente.  I DID NOT add the 10 3/4 oz water.  Thanks Diana, the dish was quick and easy to make."
19799,10367,2001-12-28,4,My kids really liked this recipe.They like to sprinkle parmesan cheese on top.
5745,4277,2001-02-23,4,"I tried this recipe but I could not figure out how to put the chocolate sauce on the ice cream.  I melted it and as I poured the hot chocolate sauce on the ice cream...it just rolled off to the sides.

Are you supposed to freeze the ice cream before you put the sauce on?

It was delicious and my 14 yr. old son was very happy!"
18660,13079,2001-11-05,4,We really liked this potato recipe. I added a teaspoon of seasoned salt. I also mixed the cheese and french fried onions in the potatoes and saved a little for the topping. We served them with London Broil. This is definatly different from the average mashed potato recipe.
8395,8701,2001-04-18,5,These ribs were out of this world.  I cant wait til summer when I can bring them along to all the get-togethers we usually get invited to....They are sure worth the effort !!!!
11514,8701,2001-07-02,5,"These ribs were just GREAT not to much work, you can put it together early then put in the oven while you visit with your gests. THANKS"
13618,8701,2001-08-01,5,"These are great.I make a similar version with the exception of a few small adjustments.
  Instead of the chili powder i use Asain chili and garlic sauce to taste.
  Then,just before they are done,say 5-10 mins.,i remove from the oven and put under a pre-heated broiler to give them just a bit of a ""mouth feel"",somewhat similar to an actual ""bbq"" ribs."
14532,8701,2001-08-15,5,I have made this recipe many times to get rave reviews and licked the platter clean!  The only alteration I make is I slow-cook the ribs at 325 degrees for about 3 hrs.  This seems to allow the flavors more time to permeate the meat plus makes for ribs which melt in your mouth.
15004,8701,2001-08-21,5,"Made these ribs this weekend and they were GREAT!! I have been looking for a good, and easy recipe for ribs.  I also modified the cooking time to 325 for about 3 hours. The sauce was a good blend of sweet and spicy.  Thanks!"
17630,8701,2001-09-05,5,"The first thing my husband said when he came in thdoor from work ""WOW..whatever's in the oven smells delicious!"" The ribs were very, very good and easy to make!
Linda"
16563,8701,2001-09-16,5,Very good and easy to put together. I baked this at 325 for 2 hours.
18207,8701,2001-09-18,5,I made these ribs for some friends. I chose the slow-cook way & then grilled them slightly. They turned out great. I got rave reviews.
17908,8701,2001-09-24,5,This was quite easy to make and got rave reviews from my family.  I will certainly keep this as a favorite.
21752,8701,2001-10-31,5,"We don't eat pork but the sauce sounded heavenly.  I made the sauce and cooked two chickens, cut into 8 portions each, for 1 hour covered and then 1/2 an hour uncovered, basting every 10 minutes.  It came out great, and what little that was left over tasted wonderful the next day cold!"
15814,8701,2001-11-14,5,"This is the second time I have made this. That tells you the recipe is excellent.
You will love it."
16667,8701,2001-11-29,5,Absolutely amazing ribs!!
19051,8701,2001-11-29,4,Sticky good!  The family really liked this recipe - thanks for sharing it.
10649,8701,2001-12-06,4,I love the simplicity. I also ADDED a little bit of garlic powder to them. Very yummy
23391,8701,2001-12-16,5,"mmmmmmm, can not wait to make more."
26484,8701,2001-12-17,2,I like my Ribs slow cooked
2054,9187,2001-06-14,4,"Tasted like good old fashioned coleslaw. I like it a little watery, so I added extra rice vinegar. I also used a red onion--to add a little more heat--and skipped the green pepper. It was great!"
6164,9187,2001-07-05,4,"Very simple and workable...thanx for sharing the same with all of us.
Do you have some more recipes like this which are not very
elaborate to make and try ?

18930,5437,2001-09-11,4,Even my chocolate lover kids loved it!
23542,13699,2001-11-13,5,This is one of my families favorite treats and one of the easiest recipes I have ever made.  It is no fail.  I used to make it every christmas.  We moved about 5 years ago and I lost the recipe.  I have been looking for it ever since.  Thank you so much.
5830,7776,2001-03-16,4,This recipe was great because uses pantry freindly ingredients and it tasted wonderful.All you need is the food processor. I love that you don't need sour cream which I never have on hand just mayonnaise it and its good.
8571,7776,2001-06-25,0,"Why would you want to add anything like mayo or sour cream? To me the basic / best ""quac"" is just:
avocado(s), onion or shallot, tomato, lime juice, garlic, cilantro, jalapeno or habanero and voila!"
5362,7776,2001-07-05,4,This is delicious and I agree that it is great because you can use ingredients that you have on hand.  It is not a traditional Guacamole but is more like a delicious advocado dip.  I would definitely make it again!
9045,8314,2001-06-25,5,"This is a great salad or side dish!
It is superb WARM, but can be made ahead of time and perked up at the last minute with some more fresh basil and lemon juice."
14613,8314,2001-09-04,5,this is indeed great. you MUST use fresh basil; dried just won't cut it.
14059,8314,2001-10-06,4,Not too shabby. Ya even got this Cajun to eat chickpeas... The wife sprung this one on me. Nicely done.
12200,10125,2001-07-11,0,One of the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made.
19975,10125,2001-09-27,5,These are the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever tasted! I will never make another recipe again.
20829,10125,2001-10-23,5,husband thought these were the grandest cookies of them all
11967,10125,2001-11-01,5,"Seariously, this is the best cookie I have ever made or tasted!!!  They cook very quickly, so be vigilant!"
5076,10125,2001-11-14,5,"thanks Dawn,
this was superb.I made it for Deepavali but already the children can´t
get their hands off it.

selvi"
21656,10125,2001-11-22,5,WOW! These cookies are without a doubt the best I've tasted! I can see that I'll be making these often from the way my family is devouring them LOL!
24633,10125,2001-11-25,5,"The only time my mother can lure me into her kitchen is with 
a great cookie recipe. Well, she found it. This recipe also proved there is nothing
wrong with her stove. These cookies are simply the best!
I plan to make dozens and distribute to neighbors, friends, and coworkers.
All you skeptics out there don't let this recipe pass you by! There are no words
for this one! WOW :O :> :I :) Yum."
21121,10125,2001-11-28,5,This recipe was simple and very tasty.  I liked the fact that the cookies weren't too sweet.  I also tried a variation and used chocolate pudding and white chocolate chips and that was ok too.
16827,10125,2001-12-08,5,These were really easy to make and are very soft and chewy! The best chocolate chip recipe I ever tried and the best tasting too. I am definitely going to try with the chocolate pudding mix next.
26517,10125,2001-12-18,5,Wonderful!!
21267,10125,2001-12-22,2,"Maybe I did something wrong, or maybe I was expecting too much.. but this recipe didn't do it for me. The flavor was kind of plain. I was expecting it to be better than Mrs. Fields cookies, but it didn't turn out that way for me.. sorry. But, the recipe is soft. I'll try again and hopefully it'll turn out better."
12601,10180,2001-07-17,0,"Dear Bill, did you try my recipe or do you just sit high on your elitist perch passing judgment on the masses?  Apparently, extensive inbreeding has left you not only unpleasant but also simple.  I will edit my recipe a little for your benefit.  This time, please give it a try before branding me.
Also get it right; I am arrogant and incredibly beautiful."
15120,10180,2001-08-15,0,"Haven't yet tried the recipe; however, I want to express my feelings about the author.  Having an open mind (and a cheerful attitude), I found the recipe quite light hearted and got a bit of a chuckle from it!  Thanks for the humor... without it, the world would be a miserable place.  Might just be that place where those others are stuck and can't get out of since they think those of us ""dumpers and pourers"" are arrogant.  Ha!  Thanks again for making my day :)"
13796,10180,2001-09-16,5,"Oh Mama Vaun!!  You really convinced me with the part about the aphrodisiac and I was determined to make this recipe.  I did exactly what you said to do and made myself the concoction in #3(except I substituted a gin martini..hehe)  That is as far as I got!  I'll have to try it again, real soon(when the headache wears off).  I can't wait!  I just hope I can get past what you say is the first step.  We will need a ""12 step"" program for ""meatloaf"".  Whatever some of the other reviews have said I must say that I loved the recipe.  It made my day.  In my present condition, after the first step, Bill's perch would be a very precarious place to be.  Glad I'm not Bill!! Thanks again for the fun..  Keep 'em coming."
12118,10180,2001-11-02,0,"It looks great, thanks.  I love chicken livers especially and never have anything to use them for other than plain and fried.  Plus everynight afterwork I open a beer, cook and take a cigarette break so it is perfect.  I know I shouldnt smoke, quit for 7 months and started again, will try again soon."
14613,10180,2001-11-14,0,"Mama Vaun, I haven't tried this recipe, but want to say that this is the most enjoyable and engaging recipe i've ever read, here or elsewhere.  thanks for the yummy-sounding recipe and seemingly sound advice.  who knew meatloaf could be this sexy? :-)cheers, milla"
16827,8591,2001-11-25,5,"I made these and canned them.  I had them on the relish tray for Thanksgiving and everyone said they tasted just like the spice crab apples we used to have years ago.  I went through 2 jars, that is how good they were.  I will definitely keep this recipe and make again!  Thank you!!!"
12307,9506,2001-07-09,5,So easy! I have three boys and they all love it! It's a recipe even a teenager can make!
18719,9506,2001-10-28,4,Super easy to make & tastes even better with lettuce & tomato on top
8398,3363,2001-04-27,5,"Very Very Good...Enjoyed So much.  I added a bit of chives and paprika, to mine...Super flavor..."
9590,4164,2001-12-28,4,A great dish!  My family loves this one...
6357,12283,2001-11-18,5,YUMMY!!!
18391,13048,2001-11-20,1,"This was not good .. I followed the recipe, but didn't try it myself as I don't like liver, however, my husband couldn't eat it, and he does like liver."
19008,10480,2001-09-23,5,This is VERY good!! I even dipped pretzels in this.
18931,10480,2001-11-20,5,I like it best with strawberry cream cheese. I might even try using it to frost a cake.
11052,7943,2001-06-14,0,"Two eggs are not enough.  I used three and it was still DRY (very tasty, but dry).  Five or six would be much better - with two it was more like a pile of onions than an onion pie."
2312,7943,2001-11-15,5,"I took the advice and went with 4 onions.  Worked well, though I could see even going with 5.  The bread crumb bottom really ties it together. Great side dish.  Would be good a brunch too."
13483,14382,2001-12-04,4,"I really loved the idea of a tortilla ""bowl"" for the containter.  It worked really well.  I did find the pepper and egg filling a little bland.  I think I'd add some refried beans and salsa next time.  Could really expand this by using fillings such as taco, seafood or cooked chicken.  Good recipe."
9869,11912,2001-11-02,5,"This is just superb!
Exactly my type of dish, the colours were great, and the flavour mmm mmmm. Will be making this again and again and.....  =)"
9121,13021,2001-10-28,5,Oh yeah - definitely one of MY favorite things to drink.  (<;
21758,13021,2001-10-30,5,"I'd just like to pint out that according to the 'zaar analysis, the calorie content is 69...interesting coincidence"
23179,13021,2001-11-12,5,I also LOVE it.....
24651,14526,2001-11-25,5,Tastes best with Orange juice that has lots of pulp.
6836,14526,2001-12-25,5,"I made this punch for my family Christmas get-together--it was a big hit with everyone!  I love the added flavor of the orange juice, and the sliced oranges make it so pretty!"
10216,13244,2001-11-18,5,Superbe! but...if you want them to go really crispy: heat a couple of Tbsp's of oil or dripping in a roasting tin and when its smoking take it out of the oven and then (and only then) put you potatoes in the tin...crispyyyy! roast them as usual and turn or shake them half way through to redistribute them and get them done on all sides
18391,13244,2001-12-06,5,mmmmmm ... simply wonderful
10649,14670,2001-12-06,0,"I didn't want to add a rating because I have not cooked this but, how could this possibly feed 9. We have roast meatbird at home and it will only feed 4-5 so how can 1 chicken feed 9? Don't take offence I was just wondering."
4203,2718,2001-01-05,5,"I have had a hashbrown casserole similar to this as well, but never got the recipe.  I am curious as how much sour cream should you put in then.  Thanks."
7236,2718,2001-03-29,5,"I found I didn't have any cream of chicken or mushroom to make the traditional Hash Brown Casserole, so I found this recipe.  I substituted 1/2 1% milk and 1/2 Half and Half for the milk, used low-fat instead of non-fat sour cream and added 1/2 cup chopped green pepper instead of 1/2 cup chopped onions.  Regular cheddar as well.  Very yummy...but a more fat than recipe..."
21262,11770,2001-10-28,5,I only used 1/4 c. instead of 1/2 c. mustard in the topping.  This is a delicious change for us!
8398,3763,2001-04-27,4,"Looks, the Easy Carrot Cake, to make.  I'm delighted with it.  I rated it # 4, cause my neighbor makes one that is Super Duper, but won't give out the recipe, for it.  Does something differently, but don't know what.  It is a better tasteing Carrot Cake.  Can't find one yet to beat hers.  Sorry.  I think, it is the second best though."
10216,14210,2001-11-18,5,What a creative thing to do with pasta... I'm sure my BF will get a kick out of this... I'll leave 2 of the yolks in if you dont mind :)) (more protein for veggie me)
6357,229,2001-11-01,4,"It was nice, made it today, had guests come over who praised it. I added 1 1/4 cups more of milk and 1 tbsp more of butter. I had to mix it real well, it was yummy!"
20371,12114,2001-10-04,4,"What a wonderful idea! I would have rated this a 5-star if only so many meatballs had not fallen apart when browning. They were certainly tasty, but next time I will make them firmer by adding breadcrumbs. My family had this tonight (I doubled the recipe and used a bigger pan) for dinner and I will make it again."
24621,10318,2001-11-25,5,"I recently made this recipe for a family get together and it was the most delicious lasgna I have ever made.  My whole family was raving about how delicious it was.  My hardest critic-(my husband) told me that it was the best lasgna I had ever made!  I was so happy to hear that! 
It was very easy to make, the recipe was easy to follow.  Although I did make one adaptation, in the cottage cheese and riccota mixture I bought a package of frozen spinach,thawed and drained off the excess liquid and added that to the cheese mixture.  The author of the recipe suggests using sliced mozzarella instead of shredded mozzarella, I did use shredded mozzarella, but next time will use sliced mozzarella, the shredded mozzarella wasn't cheesy enough for my tastes.  But the recipe was great overall and would recommend it to others!!!!!!"
9869,11877,2001-12-04,5,"I used red onions, this recipe was very good, a nice ''custardy'' sweetness. My family all gave it thumbs up, thanks for posting.  =)"
9869,12114,2001-10-08,4,"Another hit for us Bergy, the same picky teenager that liked your tuna and noodle casserole liked this a lot!!
I used more hamburger and adjusted some of the ingredients to suit doing that."
16658,12114,2001-11-15,4,This is a great and different recipe. I made the meatballs and baked them on a foil lined pan for about 10-15 mins. They stayed together perfectly. I served it with brown gravy. The whole family loved it!
27034,12114,2001-12-25,1,"I made this dish for a special meal and thought it was mediocre at best.  The meatballs fell apart and the yorkshire pudding was flat, heavy and crusty.  It also barely fed one hungry man, a starving nursing mom and a disinterested toddler.  I will not make this one again."
5147,4637,2001-02-04,5,This was my first try at muffins from scratch and they were TERRIFIC! Easy to make too!
11967,4637,2001-07-09,4,"Very yummy muffins.  I tripled the amount of lemon rind to be added, and the result was wonderful.  Very easy to make, and the blueberries remain whole and plump."
8503,2539,2001-04-19,4,"I've never heard of a low-fat pineapple milkshake. I'm excited to try this recipe because I love milkshakes, and hate fat, and pineapple in my favorite fruit. It looks unique and interesting! (Plus delicious!)"
19924,4197,2001-09-28,5,Very easy...nice soft pastry...thanks
13483,8492,2001-09-19,4,I really liked this dressing.  Certainly easy and very tasty.  I added some Dijon mustard as well.  It will be used again.  I doubt I'll ever buy a salad dressing again!!
17608,11606,2001-12-10,4,"This was the first time I've ever made cinnamon rolls and they turned out pretty good.  For the filling, I used chopped almonds and pecans and added about a tablespoon of cocoa to the sugar, cinnamon mixture.  For the frosting, I mixed 3 oz cream cheese, 1 cup powdered sugar, 2 Tbls orange juice and 1/2 a cup of mini-chocolate chips.  What a hit!  It did take a little longer, the first rising took about 2 hours, but that might have been the yeast, or it may have been too cool."
5974,4840,2001-04-05,5,"This salad and salad dressing is top-notched.  I prefer the granny smith apples and the blue cheese combo.  I add left-over grilled chicken (the best is fajata chicken), boiled egg and avacado slices, and toasted pecans or walnuts, pile it high on a dinner plate to make this salad a full meal."
14613,4840,2001-11-05,5,"fabulous recipe with a great flavor.  instead of bacon, i sliced up a fair amount of ham, and added some goat cheese instead of feta to the mix.  it was good enough to make two nights in a row."
6007,8473,2001-02-28,0,Isn't it dangerous to consume raw eggs?
10302,8473,2001-06-27,0,"I have not made this recipe yet. But in reference to eating ""raw eggs"", I have eaten them all my life in such things as ice cream and egg nog.  And, yes I'm still alive and doing well at the age of 58.  I'm going to try this recipe, probably over Thanksgiving or Christmas holidays.

2555,8473,2001-11-13,0,Very good....my family loves it.
12311,9055,2001-07-09,5,"Cooked fresh beans 10 minutes in water to cover them,  drained, added garlic chopped in melted butter. Superb!"
10966,9281,2001-06-12,5,"Comments? I am unable to harvest grandchildren for my father, Yodar ,as he's called in certain ranks, and am only able to lodge one complaint. Could you please upgrade the next shipment to overnight instead of next day air? Thanks dad, happy Father's Day."
17887,9281,2001-09-23,5,Tastes great even after canning.....
13021,10878,2001-08-23,5,"Wow, that''s fantastic!  And so easy!"
15385,10878,2001-10-23,5,really simple and really tasty..... now a favorite in my kitchen
22039,10878,2001-11-03,0,"I can't rate it because I haven't made it but it is safe to assume that for a marinara sauce to be ""the best"" you would have to include in your recipe when to add the tomatoes.  But I will admit that it sounds good."
14059,2700,2001-09-10,4,"Bay leaves, pork and olive oil. You can't go wrong with that...."
16140,13129,2001-10-25,4,"Scrummy!what a lovely side dish,just before serving I sprinkeld some fresh coriander over the dish.Would go well with currys as an unusual side dish."
26399,15367,2001-12-20,5,"Hi lali,I'm glad you liked my recipe enough
to post it here. These really are good.Hope
everyone tries them."
13483,11744,2001-12-03,5,When I first saw this and then started to make it I thought it would be far too much for two people.  Guess who was wrong!!!  It was all taken care of in short order.  I did not change anything in the recipe and it was terrific.  I like how easy and fast it was to do.  Thanks for the post.
13058,5102,2001-07-23,3,"this is a wonderful, bold and attention-grabbing dessert, the only problem is that they are very easy to overcook, and when you do they become tough. but if you watch them very carefully (don't try to do these if you are busy) they are soft, chewy and amazingly good."
16758,8579,2001-08-29,5,was very easy and very good will make again  i put it in the crock pot
21613,9813,2001-11-06,4,This recipe was very tasty and i will definately use it on my vegitarian friends. Next time I won't use as much sugar as it was a personally a little sweet.
8313,9683,2001-10-02,5,"Quick and easy to make, and everybody loved them! thanks for the recipe."
2059,13492,2001-10-31,5,These are really tasty!  It's worth it to spend extra money on the pretty-colored peppers for this dish because they look so pretty.
21752,13492,2001-11-01,5,"This is a very good recipe for vegans.  I made this with a soy mince, and added lots of grated onion.  I found some gorgeous orange and yellow peppers, which contrasted beautifully with the tomato sauce."
10404,14701,2001-12-13,5,"Hey Dorothy-another great recipe.  The only thing I changed was the cheese.  I used smoked Gouda-it's what I had on hand and it was great!  Thanks, Di"
4470,9855,2001-07-06,5,"Loved this recipe.  We often have parsnips and I frequently semi boil them until just beginning to get soft them toss them with alittle butter add some soy sauce, just a little, to get them very brown looking.  Then pop them in the oven to heat them and serve MMmmmm"
21641,11618,2001-11-12,4,These are great. I had been looking for a recipe like this for years after I had these at a luncheon once. Thanks for posting this one. :)
21694,13187,2001-10-28,5,"A delicious recipe, good on those cold nights!"
21694,12683,2001-10-22,5,One of the best pumpkin breads I have tasted.
4470,10164,2001-07-24,5,"Last night I did an ongoing  appetizer, finger food evening for my friends and the avacado rounds were a big hit.  I didn't have a fresh lemon so I substituted with lime juice and it worked well Thanks!"
10404,10465,2001-08-05,4,I made this the night before last to have cold for chicken sandwiches the next day.  Very good and so easy.  I also like the fact that its a quick cook-I did not have to heat up the house.  Diana Neal
17608,10742,2001-11-12,5,This is wonderful!  I woke up to a great aroma coming fromthe kitchen and the finished product was very tasty.
19799,3837,2001-11-09,5,"This recipe is great!I usually add whatever veggies I have in hand at the time,and it always turns out yummy."
7770,246,2001-09-06,5,"Outstanding dip for chips, but especially broc and cauliflower...My co-workers got most of it, but not before I at least got a decent taste. Thanx for a great recipe !"
14059,246,2001-09-07,5,Good stuff. Very good stuff.
19044,246,2001-12-31,5,"Very good and EASY to make.  This was a big hit with everyone.  A few of them even said, it was the best crab dip they ever tasted!!!"
9121,9101,2001-05-30,5,All I can say is...YUM!!
3111,8579,2001-07-16,0,"I will admit that the combination of the ingredients for this recipe made me a skeptic. However, I was pleasantly surprised with how delicious and tender this roast was. It melted in my mouth and I received many compliments from my family who enjoyed it as much as I did. I highly recommend this recipe!"
6719,8579,2001-08-05,5,"I highly recommend this recipe! It was the best beef roast I have ever had! I too agree that the
mixture of ingredients made me wonder, but the out come left my family and I agreeing that the  roast and gravy taste truly delicious.  This recipe makes plenty of gravy to have over mashed potatoes. Wonderful!"
13765,8579,2001-08-29,5,"I have made this roast beef for several people already,it is perfect.The only thing I changed was,I made my own gravy from a powder.It is delicious.         Nora"
15609,8579,2001-09-26,5,"I wasn't at all concerned about the ingredients.  I have used Wishbone Italian forever, mixed with worchestershire to marinate steaks in.  I never even thought of using for a roast.  Yes, the gravey is FANTASTIC!!!  Very Good!!!"
16445,8579,2001-10-01,5,I can't believe somehing so easy to make came out so delicious.  My guests all came back for seconds!  Thanks Kelly!
19853,8579,2001-10-01,5,"This was my first roast I have ever cooked, and it was wonderful!!! Easy to do and absolutely great tasting!"
20501,8579,2001-10-04,5,"this is a really good recipe,i have even made beef stew with it i just add 2 beef bouilon and 2 cups of water andstew beef cook in slow cooker very good recipe you have there"
20371,8579,2001-10-18,4,"This was very easy. I must confess my husband and son enjoyed it more than me (although I ate my share LOL). I cooked it covered, and feel it would definitely have dried out had I done otherwise. I also found the remaining gravy very salty and toned it down with about 1-1/2 cups water. It was still thick enough. Next time I will add water to the original liquid and use a blade or cross-rib roast instead of the more pricey sirloin tip. BTW, this smells divine as it cooks!"
10332,8579,2001-10-20,5,This Beef Roast was excellent! I made mine in the slow cookker and the juice wasn't real thick. I thicken some of the sauce for gravy and saved the rest of the juice to pour over the meat so it wouldn't dry out in the fridge. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.
13301,8579,2001-10-20,5,This roast had a lot more flavor than most that I have tried and that was what I was looking for. It wasn't bland like most roasts. I slow cooked mine in a crockpot
7802,8579,2001-10-24,5,Excellent recipe. The gravy is fantastic. We can''t wait to make it again.
16827,8579,2001-11-20,5,I made this roast for my family and my brothers family and we all gave it 5 stars.  Was really simple yet very good flavor and really tender.  Will definitely make again!!
17721,8579,2001-11-20,5,"I made this for dinner last night and it was
very good. The beef was tender and lots of gravy.
I usually make it with lots of garlic, oregano,and
olive oil. This was a nice change."
21694,12707,2001-10-30,5,"Love this recipe!  It was great, nothing over powered another ingredient."
8629,10859,2001-08-15,2,This is a nice casserole.  It is very easy to put together.
19717,11474,2001-11-13,5,"Incredibly delicious, and incredibly easy.  Take an extra five minutes to add a touch of class to your simple vanilla ice cream.  Including the optional ounce of rum is highly recommended."
6702,11474,2001-11-23,5,"I make this myself, though I add more butter :: grin ::: This is a WONDERFUL treat and usually can be made with what you have on hand. I also like to add some walnuts in there for a crunchy texture."
15749,7009,2001-08-23,3,"I have been looking for a good tuna casserole recipe but this one is not it. Too bland and too ""runny"" Perhaps you could cook the soup/milk first - that might provide a thicker sauce???"
8560,8519,2001-05-13,4,"I really enjoyed this bread, it was kind of heavy, but very tasty.  The vanilla frosting added a very nice touch.

Thank you
Frank"
24345,5008,2001-12-17,5,"I made this for a Christmas party - not one person could tell the difference between it and the real thing.

Canadian wiskey works great also"
16140,10052,2001-09-26,5,"Very *moreish*my daughter loved them,the sesame seeds give a nice flavour and crunch"
8611,6934,2001-04-22,5,Everytime I've served this I have rave reviews!!
12812,6934,2001-08-02,5,soooo tastey and good...one of my favorite's.
20387,6934,2001-10-06,5,This one is great to take to the office when having a breakfast.
19799,11789,2001-12-28,5,"These are really good served on a bun.Or double the sauce to use as a gravy over mashed potatoes,and top with regular swiss cheese.Yummy!"
2312,15364,2001-12-26,5,"Took these to a cookie exchange and they were a hit.  I used Scharfen-Berger semi-sweet chocolate instead of chocolate chips.  Shaped the cookies into little sort-of squares instead of pressing down with a fork, and so they were half dipped in chocolate.  Also I dipped them in chopped pistachios after the chocolate so they looked great with the green nuts on the chocolate and tasted even better with a little saltiness from the nuts to go along with the chocolate.  Loved them.  Will make them again and again."
9590,15364,2001-12-28,5,Heaven in your mouth!  Brought these to a Christmas Dinner...  Nothing but compliments.  I rolled them in chopped pecans after dipping in chocolate...
13483,9383,2001-09-04,4,I had a coffee and dessert night recently and made this.  It was the first dessert to go.  Everyone seemed to like it.
21752,9383,2001-10-31,3,"I made this for my bookclub last night, and it was finished off by the end of the evening.  The only change I would make to this would be to cut back on the corn syrup by half, it was really too sweet, and I would up the peanut butter by another 1/3 of a cup in the body of the recipe."
11044,9430,2001-06-16,0,"The spicy, sweet sauce is what makes this delicious.  My family likes it with mashed potatoes.  Be sure to cook the meat until it gets very tender and the sauce thickens."
19783,11717,2001-09-25,4,I thought that this dish was easy to make. My friends mom uses hamburger meat instead of sausage. I think I like the sausage better.
9869,14301,2001-11-19,5,"Cut the recipe accordingly for 2 servings. This recipe is great, I used red potatoes and kept the skin on, really tasty potato dish.  =)"
20160,14301,2001-12-19,5,This was yummy. I used dry basil because I didn't have fresh and I threw in some mushrooms and zuchini after the first 10 minutes of cooking.  Yum. I will make this again.
7802,8782,2001-05-16,4,"The recipe was easy to prepare, though a bit messy (all rub-on recipes are). The result was a juicy, tasty chicken that I'm sure I make again soon."
7164,8782,2001-05-31,5,"I made this over the weekend and it was very good, although I have to agree getting the rub on was a bit messy. However I will definetly make it again and am sharing the recipe with friends!"
9624,8782,2001-09-04,5,Delicious!!Worth the mess!
18660,8782,2001-10-06,5,"We loved this recipe.  The result is a juicy, tasty chicken.  Thanks for sharing. I basted with chicken broth the first few times, until enough drippings were available for basting."
16827,8782,2001-11-15,5,This was the best roast chicken I ever made or ate! My family loved it.  I will definitely make it again and again and again.
24957,8782,2001-12-03,5,very easy recipe and everybody loved it!
20371,8782,2001-12-15,0,PLEASE don't use a kitchen-can trash bag; even the unscented ones are treated with chemicals and you are really risking your and your family's health.
5273,55028,2001-01-22,5,"My favorite cake!  Mom makes this with sugar-free cake mix, sugar-free cherry pie filling, and pineapple in its own juice.  Since we're diabetic, this means we can eat some of it.  Easy to make, and popular at potlucks!"
19895,11105,2001-09-26,5,yum I think is tastes so nice where did you get the recipe from ? or who did you get it from? it was very easy to make and it handled well. what sort wine do you suggest for it like with after noon tea.
5142,8509,2001-01-22,4,"I wanted a new way to prepare thick pork chops for my family ,and this was really good. I used Lawerys season salt instead of accent, and salt. The gravy smelled a little like a marsala sauce. The meat was so tender this way, so much better than dried out broiled thick pork chops."
7384,8509,2001-03-29,5,Excellent and so simple to make.  I replaced the Accent with Lawry's Season salt.  My whole family loved them -- no left overs!  I will make these again.  Thanks for the great recipe!
1634,11427,2001-09-17,5,"This is a great "" Starter recipe "", using Parmesan Cheese as a base, that allows creative cooks to experiment a little each time until it is just right for them."
4470,11427,2001-10-01,0,Another variation is with a bit of butter and a tbsp of curry powder
16459,11441,2001-09-07,0,"If the spinach mixture gets dry while it is heating, add more olive oil."
18995,11441,2001-09-13,5,I love it!
6357,12313,2001-10-09,5,"Oh well, it is so good! I wished while I was baking this cake that I were a spoon or bowl in which the ingredients were mixed by me to make it.
I used 1 cup (minus 1 tbsp) of Fresh milk and added 1 tbsp of lemon juice instead of the buttermilk. Rest of the things I have stuck to this recipe. It's a very nice cake and quite easy too. The fact that it is eggless makes it all the more nice as many people I know don't have eggs at all, hence, I have many more soon going to be ""lovers"" of this cake! I'd say that if your depressed or low, request mom to make this for u if u love cakes n chocolate - Just put in 1 piece  of cake and watch your depression run away for miles from you:) Last but not the least, I loved the deep dark brown colour of the cake when done. I garnished it with some chopped almonds and maraschino cherries that made it look all the more yummy and mouth watering and oh well, my stomach says ""Give me more of Depression Fudge cake now and NOW means NOWWWWWW""!!!:)"
10216,12313,2001-10-22,5,"WOW, and I do mean WOW! I'd just made the cake and had it with cream, but I was bored this afternoon and made the frosting... WOW!!! death by chocolate!!! incredible!!! my BF is gunna get really sick of this cake I'm going to make it at least once a week!!! Great for visitors, a bit messy when Icing it though! LOL... Yum!"
23437,12313,2001-11-12,5,I'm from New Zealand & I don't have buttermilk at home so used milk with a tablespoon of lemon juice in it. My 9 year old daughter helped also. Easy to make. It has to be one of the niciest Fudge Cakes I've made. It's now a firm favourite in our house & at work. One problem - it never lasts long enough with 3 kids in my house.
5886,7864,2001-04-09,5,"I use fresh pineapple "" crushed in a food processor. The muffins are light and moist; a favorute of my family"
13483,12447,2001-12-04,5,"This does make a lot.  I added garlic and onion initially and cooked peas and carrots at the end to make a stew/soup.  Got 3 meals for 2 from it.  1st a soup in a bowl with buns and salad
2nd deboned and shredded chicken, thickened liquid with cornstarch and soy sauce and served over rice with tortilla and salsa
3rd over toast with veggies
Loved it."
9869,14450,2001-12-28,5,"Never really been a gin fan, but I had all the mixes for this drink. Its a pretty warm day here today and I had this really tall glass....loved it, perfect on a hot Summer day."
21657,11345,2001-10-24,5,"This was the easiest sugar cookie recipe I've ever made. My family loved them, and some friends raved about how soft they were and asked for the recipe."
9121,15042,2001-12-10,5,Thanks Anu - just what I was looking for.
7808,3186,2001-04-09,4,This recipe is perfect for entertaining.  I created a simple yet authentic French meal accompanied by these delicious gougere puffs.  Simple yet satisfying.
16827,1746,2001-11-08,5,This recipes was really easy. I did peel apples first and then just used potato masher when done. It is really good.  Thank you.
18884,11177,2001-09-11,4,"Very good and a true macaroon recipe.  To give it pazzaz, I used marischino cherries cut up into pieces and the juice.  I pour this into the final steps of the recipe before baking.  The Macaroons come out pinkish with specks of red cherries.  


The beauty of this recipe is the easy in making it.  Everything in mixed into one bowl and dropped onto the cookie sheet.  
One can also use original recipe with slivers of almonds mixed in and then put on the tops.

Thank you for a very good macaroon recipe 

meridana - 9/10/01"
9926,14125,2001-11-26,5,I recently made this for a Thanksgiving Day breakfast and it got rave reviews from everyone. I also thought that it was very easy to put together. This one is a keeper!
25541,14125,2001-12-07,5,Very good.  I used non fat yogurt along with canned whole berry cranberry sauce and it was a hit at work and at home.
25994,14125,2001-12-12,5,Oh my gosh....this is sooooo good!
10511,4269,2001-07-16,5,"Have been making these potatoes cake for some near forty years and they always been a winner.They are must recipe to have in ones recipe file. They make a great snack or a light meal.They are easy to make coked in a little butter. I like them when some flour is added. Narda
   ps. Instead of oil I use an egg."
12491,10531,2001-08-15,4,This is really good!
2555,13386,2001-11-05,0,I can hardly wait to make this...sounds interesting - and good.   Wanda in Texas
10216,10838,2001-09-18,3,"Nice, but have you tried dipping the strawberries in a fondant icing after letting the chocolate set, now that IS luxurious!"
6357,9305,2001-07-09,0,A very filling sweetdish!
13117,10370,2001-11-23,0,I really like this recipe
26241,15546,2001-12-15,5,Great recipe!
20480,12799,2001-10-17,5,I have added freshly grated parmesan cheese to this dressing; really good!
14613,8707,2001-11-05,4,"Pretty nice cake, really does taste better after a few days.  i used dried cranberries instead of raisins, which worked out well.  i also added a touch of vanilla and nutmeg to the batter."
6810,8707,2001-12-18,0,"Dear Milla, Never thought of trying dried cranberries. Now that DOES sound good! Thanks for your comment. Ann"
17803,15690,2001-12-28,5,"Bulgogi is very easy to make, it is tender and has a good flavor.  You must definitely sever this with sticky rice as s'kat says.  And while I LOVE Kimchi, those of you that don't know what these is best try a taste of it before you buy a entire jar!  We buy Kimchi by the gallon, truly."
23508,3002,2001-11-13,0,I haven't tried this reciepe by Advocaat is quite lovely. (Raw eggs and all...)  It's best served over some really nice vanilla icecream! :-)
13736,9064,2001-10-01,5,I got compliments from the family on this one. It was easy and tasted great.
12352,9064,2001-10-02,5,"This was really good. I doubled the recipe, and we had leftovers for the next day or two.  I think that the next time I make it, however, I will use about half the sugar.  Probably just use the brown sugar.  It was a little too sweet for our tastes.  Didn't go too well with bread for meatloaf sandwiches, when it was so sweet.  The salt and everything else, is just the perfect amount for flavor.  It tasted a lot like mine, except I use stewed tomatoes that have been pureed, instead of milk, and we have never done it with a sweet topping, just catsup alone.  I have eaten the sweet kind, and have always liked it.  But I will tone the sugar down a little next time.  Great recipe!"
20938,9064,2001-10-10,5,Absolutely the best meatloaf I've ever eaten!  Delicious!
7279,9064,2001-10-15,5,"I did tone down the sugar a bit after reading the previous comments.  I used all of the brown sugar, and I used just a pinch of the white sugar.  I won't even bother with it at all next time... and there will be a next time.
The directions are perfect.  It took exactly an hour, and the sweet sauce smelled ridiculously good while cooking.  I kept saying, ""Is it done yet?  Can we eat it yet?!""  It was well worth the wait.  I'm going to make it again this week.  It was hard to make it last, but two of us ate the meatloaf for three days.  Even great reheated."
12716,9064,2001-10-19,1,"Ingredients of this recipe suggested that the flavor & texture of the loaf would be lacking and sweetness of the topping overwhelming. But because meatloaf is a favorite dish of mine the 5 star rating given this recipe challenged me to try it. I cut the sugar for the topping by a third. Still, I found the topping sickeningly sweet & the texture and bland flavor unimpressive."
9690,9064,2001-10-22,0,"For the sauce, when I had posted it, I had doubled the recipe, and some found it too much. So please cut everything in half... my family doesn''t eat much of the sauce when it''s first served,they love it when scraped off the top of the meatloaf and spread on the bread for cold meatloaf sandwiches, while my husband likes it spread on a thick slice of hot meatloaf and mashed potatoes"
13483,9064,2001-10-28,3,"I had to try this after reading all the good reviews.  This was not a bad dish but I have had better to my taste.  I, too, found the topping far too sweet and the meatloaf itself was ordinary."
16758,9064,2001-12-03,5,"very good they went crazy for it.i added a little garlic salt instead of salt,it is a little sweet ,but everyone loves it ,it is a hit  thank for the recipe"
14613,3526,2001-10-29,3,The sauce was a little too sweet for my taste.
8619,8661,2001-04-22,5,Great simply prepared. classic.
13483,8661,2001-08-05,4,Good recipe and easy to make.  I found it a little bit too thick for a salad dressing so I added some white wine to dilute a bit.
17222,8661,2001-10-15,4,Great to find a real French recipe for salad dressing have been looking for one for years after living in France
15572,9148,2001-10-20,3,"Didn't have any madeira, so I used marsalla."
21694,9148,2001-10-22,4,Very good.
16856,11125,2001-10-01,5,"My family and I have been been making horseradish for the past 10 years, can't think of a better way to spend a Saturday.  Many tears in each bottle as the horseradish root is much stronger than onions."
12657,13445,2001-12-27,5,"I''ve made this recipe several times now, and I like it better each time! It tastes great served warm with a cucumber raita or plain chilled curds. I use a lot more onions than the recipe calls for too. Thanks for sharing this Mirjam! :)"
13483,11915,2001-10-03,4,"I made a dinner for two with this.  I added some shredded carrot, some garlic and salsa.  May add some cheese near the end of cooking next time.
Was a great vegetarian meal (and I am not a vegetarian but do like most veggie recipes!)  Thanks for sharing this."
22903,11915,2001-11-05,5,I added a can of corned beef to this recipe and my family liked it better than fried corned beef and cabbage.
1634,8909,2001-07-02,3,"Using the basic concept of this recipe as a starting point, this could certainly become the base for a variety of stews and cold pasta dishes."
20429,12368,2001-10-05,5,Very simple to make and tastes great!
21034,9125,2001-10-12,4,"Pretty good recipe to try, especially when you run out of eggs and want to make some kind of cookie. 

A few suggestions to dress up the graham crackers a little:

1) Prick the tops with a fork before baking.
2) Spread honey on the tops before baking; or wet the tops with a little water, and then sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar before baking."
22353,13452,2001-10-30,5,I substitute whole wheat bow tie pasta to increase fiber.  This is delicious.
21694,13452,2001-10-30,5,Absoltly delicious.  Worth the wait.
5362,13452,2001-11-19,5,"I added 1 1/2 cups of diced tasso but you could use pancetta or even ham or bacon.  It gave it a richness of flavor.  I also recommend getting a good parmasan cheese like regianno, not the already grated kind.  We loved it!  This will become one of my staple winter soups."
23099,13452,2001-12-03,5,This is the most wonderful soup that we've had in a long while. It's so flavorful.  I add a little smoked bacon to it. I gave it to several people and the comments were the same.  You have a winner here!   Happyclip
6357,11616,2001-09-13,5,Its fabulous! Keep us posted on great things like this one!!
19123,11616,2001-09-14,5,Fabulous and easy recipe!  I love it!
21741,11616,2001-10-22,5,This recipe is great and easy to make.
12657,16272,2001-12-28,4,"Lovely cookies, very easy to make! I took away one star from my rating because it was a little too sweet and took longer to bake (almost 1 hour). Next time I'll use 1/2 cup sugar insead of 3/4. Grinding the sugar helps a lot it making a more pliable dough. I made smaller ""walnut-shaped balls"" and ended up with around 5 dozen cookies! The vanilla adds an awesome flavour :)"
7507,12126,2001-09-28,0,"If you really want to get cajun = buy some fresh sweet potatoes, and bake them at 425 degrees, till the juice starts running out of them. Then let them cool to room temperature for the gumbo meal that night. 

After your guest serve themselves the gumbo & rice, suggest that they cut a sweet potato into 1 inch chunks, and add it to their gumbo. Oh it's so heavenly it'll make your teeth chatter.

Another optional thing to add to your gumbo is a little vinegar. Start with a teaspoon full, then gradually add a little at a time if you need more. Be very careful though, a little too much vinegar, and that will be all you taste = it will overcome the taste of the gumbo."
21505,8797,2001-11-29,5,"excellent!   -generally i'm a bit critical of things i make myself, but i think i may actually have liked this one..  quality meal with a lovely elegance to it, very good."
23807,2985,2001-11-30,5,"I used this recipe using all ground turkey, and used two cans of rotel, with one cup of tomato juice. It was some of the best chili I have had, and lower in fat. Thank you so much for the recipe. Dennis Baker"
26874,16115,2001-12-31,5,"A phenomenal dish. The taste was unlike anything I have made before. The flavors did not blend into each other, rather the really did act in harmony with each other. Every bite sent a shot of a different flavor, cool bitterness of the lemon, the sweet zing of of onion, the spicy bite of the sausage, the tang of the feta, and the cool sweetness of the peppers. Simply put my wife said it was the best dish I have ever made, followed by the question of when I would be maiming it again, and could we invite some friends over."
5471,144,2001-01-29,3,"It was pretty good, but then again I was really hungry.  Needs more chicken and more cheese."
14880,328,2001-11-06,5,"This soup is very creamy and yummy!  The peanut butter adds a nice, complimentary flavor.  MODIFICATIONS: I added twice as much red pepper and a little cumin.  I also suggest modifying the recipe to add the rice after you puree the squash, if you like whole rice in your soup.  Regardless, the flavor is outstanding."
7802,9427,2001-06-25,4,These were very smooth and had a good taste. Next time I think I'll use more cream cheese and/or sour cream and see what happens.
21784,9427,2001-10-22,4,"A bit hesitant to add the full amount of cheese and butter.  Thought I would have enough left over for the next day.  Four of us enjoyed the lot.  Will definitely make it again but just go light on the butter only.  Thought it would be sloppy but no, and certainly a good talking point at the table.
Enjoying the last of our old potatoes ""downunder"" before we dig our new spuds with mint sauce.  Yum."
19895,540,2001-09-26,3,Sorry it went a little sloopy but the kids liked it.
23107,13958,2001-12-04,5,Mysterygirl -- this tuna steak recipe was absolutely wonderful and thanks so much. I really didn't think we would like it but it is sooo good.
9869,3463,2001-08-16,4,"Had this for dinner tonight, although we dont get the stuffing mix you used..I used a sage and onion one....my husbands comment was...'mmmm, this meat is tasty'...enjoyed by us all  =)"
24735,9179,2001-11-26,5,"This is SOOOO good!!! I've made it now for three seperate get togethers/potlucks and everyone loved it! I found it best to make a day ahead so that it marinates, and it just makes it convenient to take it out of the fridge. I also just served this with crackers instead of bread to save time. YUMMMY!!! Be sure to bring the recipe with you--everyone will want it!"
17057,4178,2001-09-17,5,This casserole was very easy to make and was absolutely delicious!  I made it for company that we had over to cookout and there was none left and everyone wanted the recipe.
22244,4178,2001-11-25,5,"I was a bit skeptical, but tried this recipe anyway, since I had all ingredients on hand.  Now all this reformed doubter can say is DELICIOUS!  I followed the instructions down to the 8x8 dish even though I was very tempted to use a 9x13 casserole dish.  My husband (who doesn't share my passion for cornbread) really loved the outcome.  Thanks!"
24775,4178,2001-11-27,5,Very tasty and so easy to make!
8631,12278,2001-11-08,3,"I found that the recipe wasn't sweet enough for the kids, however, my husband liked them.  Thanks"
16459,11911,2001-10-03,4,My little girls loved it!
4470,12359,2001-10-06,5,"Great easy, tasty recipe
I boiled the sausage first and pricked them (this gets rid of all the fat), threw in some mushrooms, sweet & hot pepper as well as the onion.  Used Peri Peri sauce instead of tabasco.  Thanks Elizabeth, cheers Bergy"
16459,15900,2001-12-27,5,Hey Grandpa Harry! I liked this recipe. I left out the tabasco sauce because my sausage was really spicy. Next time I'll add it. I'm thinking the next time I make this dish I'm going to add a layer of cornbread over the top and bake it longer.
11587,7762,2001-06-25,4,Absolutely gorgeous.
11044,7762,2001-07-30,2,more orange flavored than ginger
22076,10955,2001-10-25,2,There is no temp. Instructions for this.
4433,601,2001-01-10,5,"Made it for daughter's wedding, a GREAT hit!!"

2059,4214,2001-06-11,5,Simple and elegant; it's hard to go wrong with pork & apples.
17613,4214,2001-12-29,5,"The Danish name for the recipe is æbleflæsk, and its absolutely delicious. We always use it on Rye Bread as an open sandwich. Thank you... Lene"
19995,13661,2001-11-12,5,"My mom made these for me the other day, and they were fabulous!  I don't know where Elizabeth comes up with these exquisite recipes, but they are absolutely heavenly!  Keep 'em coming!"
21694,3549,2001-10-22,5,"Very delicious, I will have to make this at Christmas also."
21752,3549,2001-11-05,5,The year I was 7 we lived in Norway for a year.  My aunt used to make this for us as a special treat for breakfast.  This one REALLY brings back memories!
9869,10246,2001-08-15,5,This was delicious..loved the mix of flavours.  =)
14613,10246,2001-10-29,2,"Maybe it was the flavor of the wine, but this didn't really do it for me.  It had a tang that was almost bitter."
6357,10305,2001-09-04,3,Quite a nice one!
13593,3451,2001-08-06,5,"This is simple and good.  Also, important to note I already had the ingredients on hand.  I used scallops instead and it was just as delicious.  Thank you."
12200,10050,2001-07-09,0,Wow a great recipe for German Potato Salad.  I tryed many a recipe and this one is the best I have ever had.
16140,10050,2001-09-24,5,Lovely salad.
21704,12848,2001-10-22,0,"i want to know where she got this recipe from, a simular recipe was given to me about 15 yrs ago from a friend except that you use dorito naucho chip, grated cheese, and a can chopped black olives ,it adds more flavor to the recipe and tastes good with any meal."
21439,12848,2001-10-25,0,"It is a recipe that my mother passed down to me, I'm really not sure where it originated from. 
I love it with the black olives too but my husband isn't a fan of the olives so we have it without. It really is good with any meal."
21262,4002,2001-10-19,5,"I forgot to put the cinnamon in the dough, so I mixed 1/2 tsp with the 2 Tb sugar that was sprinkled on top.  Made these with finely chopped walnuts instead of pecans because that's what I had on hand.  WOW! They're delicious!!"
2555,4002,2001-11-10,5,"Wow....really good.  Easy to make...would made nice gifts.  I'm going to chop the nuts finer next time.  My husband and I loved them.

Wanda in Texas"
7619,3858,2001-04-09,4,"This recipe needs to include some sliced carrots. I think they can be substituted for some of the peas, but they are definately something that needs to be added to break up the color a bit. About 1/2 cup should do."
8631,3858,2001-07-19,4,"It was very good, I did however, add quite a bit of spices and diced up a red pepper."
21752,15521,2001-12-11,5,"Excellent idea!  I can't leave recipes well enough alone, so I added more broccoli, changed the bread to a caraway rye, and the cheese was a smelly Emmenthal.  With a dash of red pepper flakes I had a great lunch!"
6357,14464,2001-12-03,5,"WOW! I loved it, its so tasty and yummy, I licked my fingers clean to the last bite:)
I especially loved the apricot sauce, that was yum!"
9869,11660,2001-12-04,5,"A definite 5*, will be on our barbecue menus over the months ahead!"
12200,10232,2001-07-17,0,Great tasting pickles.
17785,10173,2001-09-04,4,"Thank you, thank you.  We have a highbush cranberry in our yard, and I've been searching for a jelly recipe for ages.  I finally found yours and it's just what I was looking for.  Thanks, again."
10233,2935,2001-06-05,1,"I didn't try the recipe...there seemed to be something missing from the recipe my mother gave me.
This recipe is from Epe in Gelderland in Holland.
To 2 litres of boiling beef stock (16 cups)add 500g (1lb) of minced lamb fry (liver) and 500g (1lb) minced beef. 
When boiling, add salt 'til it's too salty (approx 15 teaspoons).  In addition, add AllSpice (Pimento) 'til it's too spicy (approx 5 teaspoons).
Boil rapidly until meats are cooked.
Take the pot off heat, then add (quickly) approx. 2lb (1kilo) white flour stirring continuously until it's a 'lump' which you can't stir anymore (you may need help with this as the arms go into heavy duty mode).  Try to ensure that the flour is evently stirred with no lumps.
Spoon into (floured)containers and leave to chill.
Turn out from container once chilled and cut into 1cm slices, then fry in extremely hot pan with preferred oil, butter or fat until dark brown and crispy.  (Good idea to fry outside as can leave 'blue' smoke throughout house)
A great winter meal or snack...always wanting one more slice!"
8908,9410,2001-07-24,0,Cook it at 375 for 3 hours. I would think that it qould be burnt to a crisp.
26822,15477,2001-12-22,5,"Thank you soooo much Angela, you saved me!  I bought all the stuff to make these cookies yesterday and then I couldn't find my recipe.  I'm back in business.

Happy Holidays"
4470,7609,2001-12-03,5,Really enjoyed your recipe!   We don't get catfish here so I used New Zealand Blue Hoki (Haki) and it was enjoyed by all.  The horseradish sauce has just enough flavor and I will make this for other recipes too.  Thanks
25267,14624,2001-12-04,3,Great mexican dish yummy simple and tasty.
23948,5291,2001-11-18,5,"This is a simple and delicious recipe . I have been searching for a very long time for one like this! Try it , you'll love it!!"
27460,8635,2001-12-31,5,I have made this cake several times and it's always delicious. All who have tried it wanted my recipe.
7747,1069,2001-04-05,5,Kids loved watching the crystal form! We added food colour to this recipe for fun.
26179,13916,2001-12-14,5,had this last night at our ladies bunco club. big hit that disappeared in ten minutes!
5060,16139,2001-12-27,5,"Bergy, this was very very rich, every one loved it but could only eat a spoonful, it was so rich.
The next time I make it I would just use whole milk instead of the evapourated skim.  It was an excellant dish for a Seafood feast buffet. Thank-you for a new dish added to our annual event.

26158,14202,2001-12-15,4,"This is an interesting twist on the infamous S.O.S. (Swell ole Stuff) that all Marines learned to eat in boot camp.  We always had it for breakfast and it was served over toasted bread.

In about 1999, ""Leatherneck,"" the magazine for Marines, held a recipe contest for SOS.  The winning recipe ws similar to this recipe, but included seasoning with Soy Sauce and Worcestershire Sauce.  That recipe also included a cup of finely chopped onions.

I tried this recipe and it works well.  I like the idea of having the nutritional information too."
21613,11808,2001-11-21,5,"The first time I made this it was great, the second time I used a mixture of different types of mushrooms and it was still great."
14531,8809,2001-08-15,5,"I have just found this recipe and my mouth is watering!
Im off to try it...yummy!!"
12716,9803,2001-10-19,4,"I liked the texture and flavor of the loaf. Not the very best I've eaten, but it's right up at the top.  I will keep this recipe and prepare it again."
21694,13341,2001-10-28,4,Very good and not hard at all.
18660,12220,2001-10-15,5,"I agree with the recipe description: simple, but good! This sald tastes like many of the deli salads available in grocery stores or salad bars. I served it with another Recipezaar dish Greek Phyllo Chicken. The creamy dressing adds flavor to the crisp vegetables."
21694,12220,2001-10-20,4,"Good, but I did not like the dressng too much."
24707,12220,2001-11-26,5,"I changed a few things for this, and the family loved it. I put in  1/2 can of chopped black olives, added 1/2 cup of chopped green olives, and used zesty italian dressing-enough to coat everything.  Big hit with stuffed cheese egg shells that had been baked in ragu sauce. Thanks. Peggy"
16140,9851,2001-09-28,5,Devine!
13736,9379,2001-08-10,5,Very easy to make and delicous. I will try different fruits next time.
25875,15247,2001-12-10,0,"Hi,
My Grandmother used to made this for us when we were little, we loved it.
Watch out, because it's great for pulling out teeth...very sticky."
6357,11670,2001-09-16,3,I liked the name very much!!
19799,11670,2001-10-12,5,"Good Recipe,my kids loved it."
8313,16599,2001-04-18,5,the best recipe for brownies I have ever found.
11483,9429,2001-06-20,5,Excellent recipe!.. So GOOD u can't stop eating them..more addictive than pringles. GOTTA TRY IT!!
6357,14584,2001-12-17,5,"This is just like my ""Cherry Chiffon Dessert"".
I've added a cup of mini-marshamallows in it, otherwise its the same. This is really a dream thing to have. Guess we share the same tastebuds:)"
26471,14831,2001-12-17,2,"The dough was very dry and difficult to roll into balls. When I attempted to make the indentation in the top of the cookie, they fell apart. I suspect there should have been additional butter or other liquid in this recipe."
22015,13868,2001-12-26,5,These are excellent and sooo easy to make.  Thanks for posting this one.  It will be made again and I doubt that we wait for Christmas next time.
17642,9074,2001-09-04,4,"Great and tasty recipe, very easy to make. I made 8 servings for a party and received many comments."
23202,2484,2001-11-08,5,"This recipe could almost pass as a dessert.  It was very easy & quick to prepare and a great way to ""flavor up"" the carrots."
26022,3264,2001-12-31,4,"This is the first recipe given a thumbs up by all three of my children. Oh well. I substituted toast cut into oblong shapes (they look more finger like, after all)."
16140,10748,2001-09-21,5,This was very tasty I did add a Tsp of freshly grated ginger to it.
8000,10748,2001-09-23,2,"Oh, no.  Interesting, but this isn't how Germans would do it.
You need sliced frankfurter, or sausage, and carrot."
22015,14787,2001-12-10,5,"The kids had a blast with these.  We made some with both regular & sugar free candies.  Either way they turned out fun.  We did discover that you don't want to smash the candies into dust, leave them in some chunks for a prettier look."
15712,14787,2001-12-13,5,"This is a fun recipe.  To do it with a group of kids, do not line the cookie sheet.  Instead, have each child assemble their cookie on a piece of aluminum foil.  Write each name on the corner of the foil with permanent marker.  Now, it is easy to remember which cookie goes with which child.

By the way, any sugar cookie recipe will work for the dough."
17608,14787,2001-12-20,4,"This was pretty time consuming, but the outcome was worth it.  I didn't put the stick in them and am trying to figure out a way to put a little hole through them so I can hang them as ornaments. The dough was good, I tasted a little out of the bowl, nice honey flavor.  I did have to add a bit of water becuase it just wouldn't come together.  I used 2 bags of Jolly Ranchers to finish the whole batch of dough.  Very pretty!"
4470,9239,2001-07-30,4,"Very easy, quick and good!  Thank-you for all the wonderful recipes that you submit."
11455,12966,2001-10-22,5,this is a recipe i've been looking for for years.  i found it in a ladies magazine when my grown children were babies.  it was called chicken almondine it was put out by kraft.
15572,14152,2001-12-08,4,"I added a dash or two of vanilla and a little nutmeg.  ""Maaahvelous!"
7096,131,2001-03-25,5,"Very, very good!  Suggestion -- this makes a smallish loaf, so set your bread machine to ""light,"" if possible, to prevent over-browning of crust.  Great flavor and texture!"
23027,131,2001-11-07,5,One serving of this bread = 1 bread diabetic exchange
2312,6713,2001-11-15,3,"Tasted good, but the sauce just got too thick to really amount to much.  It tasted good, but I think the sauce should really just cook off the alcohol and then reduce to just thicker than an aus ju.  The garlic just makes it too thick after reducing the wine to syrup."
26423,3450,2001-12-17,5,"This punch was super easy to make, just add all the ingredients and mix.  I served it at my bridal shower and at my wedding and it was a hit!"
6719,9836,2001-07-28,5,"Very easy to make, taste wonderful, I cut the boneless chicken into cubes before placing in crockpot. Served over egg noodles. My husband loved it and that means it has to be good!"
10332,9836,2001-10-09,5,I made this for supper tonight and I can not believe how tender it is.  I love this meal!
23027,9836,2001-11-09,5,"My husband loved it! Served over noodles. However, watch the chicken in the crockpot and make sure it's always covered. The tops that were sticking out were dry(my fault). Heard hubby bragging to daughter how good it was. Thank you."
13483,9836,2001-11-12,5,I can only ditto what the others have said.  This was a terrific dish.  I had enough leftovers for a cheesy chicken open face hot sandwich for dinner tonight.  Great crockpot recipe.
21487,9836,2001-11-23,5,This was so easy and such a great tasting dish. I served it over rice. Next time I may add a small can of green chiles to it for a dah or color and taste. Thanks again!
16459,9836,2001-11-26,5,I made this for my husband's grandmother and she said it was good. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT A COMPLEMENT THAT REALLY IS. She never likes anything I cook! It was very tender and a great way to serve chicken. I think you could use many other sauces and soups and make lots of variations on this dish.
20159,9836,2001-12-14,3,I used 1 lb of chicken and reduced the soups to 1 can of the cream of chicken and 1 can of cheddar cheese soup.  Added minced garlic rather than the powder.  Cooked on low 6 hours.  The chicken turned out a little dry even though it was totally coveredy by the sauce.  Think I should have reduced the cook time to 4 or 5 hours.  Sauce was still good!
18778,9836,2001-12-25,5,"Absolutely wonderful!  I have a large (and very picky) family to cook for and they all loved it!
It was cheap an easy to make.  Great for low-budget tasty dinners."
25925,9836,2001-12-29,5,very easy and very good!
20371,9836,2001-12-31,5,"This is the recipe that I just christened my new crockpot with, and it turned out just as everyone said it would: moist, creamy/cheesy, and tasty. I goosed it up with some cayenne, and cooked it at low for 6 hours and 15 minutes, and served it with penne noodles and green beans. Everyone at the dinner table loved it! I will definitely make this again :-) It was very easy, too!"
27309,5452,2001-12-29,1,THE RECIPE is very easy to cook .but its taste is very bad.
16676,11174,2001-08-31,5,fantastic...the taste of the warm apples and flavor with a cup of hot coffee ...
23389,14649,2001-12-07,5,"This recipe is great!!! My kids are quite picky and weren't thrilled with the thought of chicken again, but they really liked this.  My husband even thought he might be able to make it.  I made it up on Sunday night and then had him put it in the oven for supper on Monday while I was at work.  I left out the salt because the crackers are quite salty and it was wonderful.."
15609,12128,2001-10-01,5,"I used 4 breasts instead of the legs, and just put everything in the dish and popped into the oven.  There were NO leftovers."
7381,1106,2001-08-15,4,"Very good cookie.
I had to adjust my cooking time and temperature
 20min at 375F.
These cookies were shared and appreciated."
4470,8336,2001-07-16,5,We really enjoyed this chicken! I added the oregano to the marinade and tripled the garlic. Love garlic!
18765,11061,2001-11-20,2,"I thought the bread was a little dry, but doesn't everything taste great from a bread machine anyway?  The jalapeno bread I had recently at a barbecue place in TX was very moist and soft, with just a little hint of jalapeno.  I'm still looking for the perfect recipe.  Really, this wasn't bad."
6357,8684,2001-06-14,0,"I love roomali roti and panner too, so what more could I ask when I get both on a platter right before me:)"
25059,15080,2001-12-06,0,"These are wonderful, not too spicy, great flavor. I like to dip them in hot cheese soup!"
6408,4009,2001-05-25,5,"the recipe for the sauce was excellent, though i used different types of shellfish. on the whole, i think that you can use other types of shellfish that is the most available to you."
17076,8668,2001-08-31,4,"I also added a cup of cooked, diced chicken and substituted one cup of regular milk with a can of evaporated milk.  Really made it rich and creamy!  My family loved it, and I baked mini cornbread muffins to go with it.  Great meal!
(nstructions called for adding celery and potatoes, however celery was omitted from the ingredient list.  I added 1 cup of diced celery, it was fine and you could add more or less to your own taste.)"
16676,13628,2001-11-21,5,"now this one is to die for a fantastic wounderful 
you have to try it..."
4535,9219,2001-06-06,5,"This Chicken recipe tasted great, my family really liked it. Also the left over chicked breast made great sandwiches on a kiaser rool.
It did take longer to prepare than the recipies I usually make but it was worth the effort!"
18415,8668,2001-09-18,4,"When I made this soup for my very particular children, they all voted on the rating and I was surprised how high they rated it!  This soup will be served frequently in my home!"
21234,8668,2001-10-28,5,"I agree with previous ratings. Added the chicken, used cream instead of milk. Served right away - a big hit. Served next day  - even better! Very easy too."
7802,8668,2001-11-05,5,"Excellent recipe. I doubled it and added a 1/2 pound of bay scallops. Next time, and there will definately be a next time, i'm going to a milk/cream combination. Thanks for posting this recipe."
16970,10998,2001-08-29,3,"Sounds good.  A word of warning to people who have to eat ""gluten free."" If you use vinegar made from grain (which most are) it is not a gluten free recipe."
23445,6633,2001-11-25,5,I made this cake the night before Thanksging. It was a hit! It's wonderful with a hot cup of coffee.
13387,7596,2001-07-28,3,"Very nice, not too sweet. Good breakfast bread."
7713,3225,2001-04-04,5,This dish is always a hit!
9869,4127,2001-12-10,4,"Made these today, even with greasy hands mixture was hard to handle, used 2 spoons in the end, passed the taste test. =)"
25115,4337,2001-12-26,5,"WOW!  This was incredible.  ""A waterfall in the mouth!"" ~commented one guest.  Careful though, it is so good that you'll want to slather the butter on.  It's addictive and delicious, so watch out!"
5523,7217,2001-03-14,3,Hey. Got this recipe in the March 8th news letter. tried it last weekend. not bad.
10394,5277,2001-06-04,4,Some of the BEST Bread Pudding I've had in years!  You've got to try it!
4470,1574,2001-07-16,4,"I love this dish. To me it is a winter comfort food.   I think that after  you say to add water to the potatos it should say ""boil until tender and drain"".  Am I right? And then add the kale etc.
Thanks for sendind this in!"
13588,6969,2001-08-01,0,id leave a head space on this  and id also would hotbaththis  for at lease 15 mins  as this sounds like my pickled orka  i canup  thank you cindy
16777,10607,2001-09-19,5,"very good vegetarian dish, I had enough vegetables for two cassaroles.  I did use half zuchinni and summer squash along with the eggplant.  One dish I topped with mozzarella cheese and the other I pureed into a delicous soup and added alittle curry. Yum"
11297,580,2001-06-25,4,Easy and tasty.  Really made my steak special.  Thanks Doreen.
10217,8483,2001-05-30,5,"This is an excellent concoction!  My guests loved it so much I had to give them a ""take out"" bag - reluctantly!  I used  Romano and Parmesan together - it rocked.

Thanks, Linda!"
12628,8483,2001-07-30,4,This dip is fabulous and makes a large quantity.  I am freezing half of it before baking it and expect it to be just as good when I serve it later.  This recipe combines sooooo many good things - it's the best I've ever tried!
4828,671,2001-01-16,4,"I finally found the recipe for ""Chow Chow Pickles"".
This is an old fashioned southern recipe and the only ingredient missing are peppers. Thank you so much as I have searched the Internet in every Search Engine and nobody had this recipe. (Although I did not look for ""Cucumber Relish"")"
13763,671,2001-08-06,4,Will Make alot of this Relish!! Good with everything!!!
8319,9978,2001-07-09,5,"My family has used this recipe for years. It's wonderful! Refreshing, not too sweet. Everyone loves it!!"
12386,9978,2001-07-09,5,very delicious and easy to make
7308,9978,2001-07-30,0,Let the slush sit for a couple minutes before serving.  The slush will become very thick and smooth.
24567,9978,2001-11-25,5,"This is such a great recipe that we decided to add it to our Navy wives' club cookbook.  We used to freeze the fruit mixture into rings, put the rings into a punch bowl and then pour the ginger ale over the top before serving.  Very attractive, especially if you decorate the rings with whole strawberries or blueberries."
22315,11491,2001-10-28,5,Emeril himself couldn't have erected a more tasteful delight.
22015,11491,2001-11-16,5,These were a definite hit in my house.  Nice easy recipe to pull out whenever you don't feel like doing a lot of cooking.
6357,11121,2001-08-29,5,It was easy to make and tastes perfect!
18723,11121,2001-09-10,5,Soup has a great taste and is so easy to prepare.
16459,11121,2001-09-13,0,"If you want to make the recipe a little richer, add cream instead of milk or add a dollop of sour cream to it when serving. Sometimes I will add some basil when I'm feeling fiesty."
23027,11121,2001-12-29,5,Wonderful comfort food. Even my husband ate it (he doesn't care for tomato soup) Served with Hot Mexican Corn Bread #11012. Very filling and great go together.
11295,9482,2001-06-18,0,mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
4470,10909,2001-09-13,5,Loved these Lamb balls. Try making them into patties and serve as a hamburger on a bun!  mmmm Thanks Laur
22468,14453,2001-12-16,4,"i used chicken legs instead.
the chicken was so tender!
very good!"
23913,14453,2001-11-20,5,I thought at first yuck pepsi chicken but let me tell you I tried it and the kids went nuts for it excellent receipe would recommend it to all......
25582,14453,2001-12-08,3,A lot better than it sounds but VERY sweet.
4098,14453,2001-12-10,5,This is a great recipe....can also cook pork chops using this recipe and coke works as well as pepsi
23139,14453,2001-12-13,5,"This was delicious! I had some chicken in the freezer and was in the mood for something different. I came here to find a quick easy recipe and decided on Pepsi Chicken. Im glad I did because it was a sucess. Very good flavor! I will hang on to this recipe for sure! AMAZING! This chicken was soooo easy and had the best Bar-B-Q flavor. Little time,little effort to make and the ingredients were on hand! My husband loved it and couldnt believe that it was made with pepsi,butter and ketchup. I will be useing this recipe over and over. Thank You!"
25293,3748,2001-12-19,5,"I love the ease and versatility of this recipe!
I added 2 cups of mashed sweet potatoes. My miniature loaves(I baked them in
 small soup cans for slicing into rounds and serving at a party) were delicious and very moist.
Next time, though, I will add a bit more cinnamon for my taste."
12812,9782,2001-07-23,5,excellent..my whole family love's it...yummy.
16594,9782,2001-08-29,5,"Excellent, The same as Olive Gardens recipe."
19743,9782,2001-09-24,5,"We're very pleased!  Tastes just like the Zuppa we get at Olive Garden.  Thanks!

Larry Souders"
20643,5334,2001-10-06,2,I used a 9 inch square pan. Bottom layer is thin. I also added half teaspoon of baking powder. I found the proportions of the two layers off. I halfed the topping which was enough for the 9 inch square size. Very moist. Might try again with less liquid.
19008,10205,2001-09-13,5,I agree! It''s hard to stop eating these! I''ve made 2 batches already!
5585,8575,2001-02-04,5,"Incredible flavor, easy and quick but tastes like an all day affair."
5088,8575,2001-12-15,1,There seems to be a lot of coconut milk for such a small quanitity of stock.  I also think there is too much chicken in this recipe and will use less than 1 lb.  It is only 3 cups so the ratio of 1 1/4 lbs of chicken to 3 cups of soup just doesnt jive
13483,10183,2001-09-26,5,"Did it again Bergy!!  I microwaved the spuds, cooked the onions, put it together in the am and cooked it later that night.  The onion and potato each had their flavours come through distinctly.
Good veggie dish."
6836,9780,2001-07-05,5,"These are fantastic!  Very juicy & tender, and the maple syrup isn't overpowering.  I highly recommend!  -Mary"
16758,9780,2001-10-06,4,"well it is easy to make, my grandson and husband really love it they thought the gray had a good tastemy grandson is 5 he said i was the best cooker in the world,thanks for the recipe"
21399,9780,2001-12-16,5,"These were wonderful!  I didn't have time to use the crockpot so I did them on the stove top on a low heat.  It took about 2 hours to cook them, but watch them close the last 1/2 hour of cooking.  The maple and applesauce turned into a thick syrup that coated the ribs nicely and even was a little crispy in some places.  Very sticky, but very yummy."
17803,9780,2001-12-20,4,I agree easy to make good taste. You don&#8217;t get all sticky messy from these.  But we do love sticky messy ribs too.
12657,12130,2001-12-21,2,"Sorry, but I didn't like this very much. It was just too spicy, even without adding the red chili powder; and the soyabean nuggets didn't absorb the flavour of the dal very well. The whole recipe (2 servings) easily serves 3 over rice, or with rotis. Also, cooking time was way over 10 minutes, around 20 actually."
4470,11382,2001-09-23,5,"I used lite olive oil and topped with fresh crumbled bacon bits,  very good"
4910,10190,2001-11-02,5,"I do not like tomato sauce and this recipe was the best I have ever had for cabbage rolls. My husband wants me to make it once a week. You may serve this for guests for dinner, they will love it   sharron cant vancouver b.C."
5076,10190,2001-11-14,5,"I played around with the amount but the end results was definitely great.

selvi"
19966,10190,2001-12-08,5,"From Preshy-- This is terrific!  I have made stuffed cabbage rolls for years, trying almost every recipe I have come across, and this one is the best. I has a wonderful flavor and will definitely be on my list for casual company dinners.  I put more filling in each roll and it took a larger pan.  My choice for sides were mashed potatoes and green beans."
18551,10190,2001-12-13,5,"This is a most fabulous recipe!  I just loved it.  Now, if I could just get someone to do all the 'leaves' prep.  I wish I knew the most efficient and easiest way to de-leaf the cabbage. I also added a mini bit of homemade tomato sauce to the 'sauce'.... just to give it a rosy glow and a hint of tomato... but not strong."
6134,2942,2001-02-28,3,good and if prepared ingred. already then only takes approx. 6 min. equalling fast!!
9203,2942,2001-05-10,5,This is an outstanding punch! I used the recipe for a baby shower for 36 servings. I want to mention to use frozen concentrate lemonade.The preparation was so easy and I'm sure everyone will just go nuts over it. Try it now!
19783,11795,2001-09-24,5,This is a very good dish. Simple yet tasty
10678,8935,2001-06-11,5,"Excellent and super easy to make. Served over ""plain"" basmati rice and the combination is wonderful."
14933,8935,2001-08-15,5,Awesome!  Very easy and tasty.
16140,8935,2001-09-04,5,Excellent and very easy to make
7923,5223,2001-06-25,5,"Very easy recipe to use as a base for your imagination.  I added chopped jalapenos and pureed it for a spread to use over toasted, pita triangles."
21618,12806,2001-10-20,5,"Very Impressive, just like Mother makes"
22425,13403,2001-10-29,0,I make a similar salad but I add whole kernal corn and avocado
12943,5060,2001-07-24,0,why no walnuts??? omega 3 fatty acids...let's compromise and make it half walnuts half pecans
25690,13403,2001-12-08,5,I made this for a football party and it was a hit!!!  Everyone loved it!  I used Kraft Ranch dressing.  But here's a hint..if you use the recommended onions they are pretty overpowering so I suggest you add onions to taste or else you better not be kissing anyone!!:)
24077,16009,2001-12-26,5,I had this as part of my Christmas dinner this year and it was most tasty. Will certainly be having this again - many thanks Diane!
9158,4897,2001-05-07,5,"A delicius soup, perfect taste the only thing is that I change the oil I brush the vegetables with olive oil, and is very good.  If you have a recepe of eggplant in the oven with tomate and cheese I will like to hear from you, thanks, thelma"
22523,4897,2001-11-02,5,This soup is the easest and the most delicious soup I have ever had. Elena Olivieri
16140,4897,2001-11-12,5,"Lovely,I added a 1 tsp freshly grated ginger to it as well."
6313,593,2001-03-12,5,"This recipe has been used in our family for many years.  My problem now is that I have trouble finding green tomatoes!

The recipe is very simple, but I salt and pepper the tomatoes a little and add a little white flour to the cornmeal.  My mother would sprinkle a little sugar - white or brown - on the tomato after she turned them.  When the sugar melts and is crusty the tomato is done."
23645,14300,2001-11-15,5,"This recipe is a favorite of mine. It is easy and wonderful. If strawberries are not available, a good substitute is (canned) mandarin oranges."
20041,2695,2001-09-28,0,"There were two recipes that I received in the late fifties or 60's.  They were so great then.  The other recipe was Orange Jello Cake, using Orange Jello with White Cake Mix.  They were fast, simple, moist, and rated excellent then.
My recipes are packed for moving; so I cannot give you the baking temperature or time."
22644,13512,2001-11-08,5,"Very cute, good for giving out when there are lot of children at holiday gatherings."
26006,13512,2001-12-15,5,"I have been making and selling this at local craft fairs for the past several years.  You would not believe how fast this moves off the shelves.  Young and old love this!  <akes a great stocking stuffer, classroom gift exchange idea, etc......"
23273,12783,2001-12-18,5,I used a little more garlic.  Great Dish
13778,10205,2001-08-06,5,"The last recipe I had for this cookie didn''t work at all, 
but THIS ONE is fantastic! 
Only one problem... getting me to stop eating them!! Ha!"
14468,10205,2001-08-15,5,Hey Mom!The cookies are GREAT!!!
17928,10205,2001-09-06,5,"This is a recipe that is also easy for kids to make. Me and my kids loved making them.
                                  Jeff Wilson"
19425,10205,2001-09-19,0,This recipe is also excellent if you omit the chocolate. I boil the mixture 3 to 4 minutes for a more firmer fudge -like texture. This is one of my all-time favorie recipes. I subsitute butter instead of margarine for a richer taste. I love this recipe!
16140,10205,2001-09-21,4,Absolutely delicious!
19705,10205,2001-09-23,4,"These are my favorite no bake cookies, I had lost my reciepe for these and couldnt remember how much went in, Thank you, I also love that I can have a cookbook on here!"
8728,10205,2001-10-01,5,This cookie is great! I haven't had the best history with no bake cookies. But this is the best recipe I have ever tried after looking long and hard for a good no bake cookies.
20722,10205,2001-10-07,5,This is one of my favorite cookie recipes.  Especially when I don't want to heat up the kitchen. This is the cookie my family fights over.
27323,10205,2001-12-28,5,One word..... YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :o)
9082,2746,2001-05-04,4,I used veggie meat instead of beef and it turned out quite good
9869,15415,2001-12-18,5,"Having a coffee and a marzipan bar as I sit and type this, mmm mmmm, the marzipan flavour through this bar is divine. I used rum and craisins.
Very good!"
12192,3007,2001-07-31,0,"To be honest, I just put a cup of milk in the microwave, take out warm milk, add a table spoon of granulated coffee, (maxwell, nescafe..any will do) add sugar for taste, best cafe au lait you'll ever taste."
12200,10154,2001-07-13,0,One of the best cakes I have ever tasted
13037,10154,2001-07-24,4,"A great cake,easy to make, bit difficult to cut. Recipe does not state eggs as an ingredient and then says add eggs (how many)? I added 2 and this seemed to be okay."
13625,10294,2001-08-06,5,"I used butter instead of margarine; 6 carrots, 5 eggs, 3 spoons of vanilla and made some other (less dramatic) changes. The cake worked out great though! Thanks!!!"
16140,10294,2001-09-07,5,I also used Butter and added 1/4 tsp of ground nutmeg and cloves.Nice moist cake and kept well.
20480,10294,2001-10-16,5,The best and you can freeze it.
19246,10294,2001-11-05,5,I tried the cake with carrtos first and it was very tasty. Then I swiched the carrots with apples and added some more chunky apples in the middle of the cake with 1 cup of walnuts. Worths trying...
10701,100,2001-06-06,3,was a bit fiddley but good. I used Wild Turkey bourbon instead & added a few rasins.
20399,10667,2001-10-03,5,It is a good and quick recipe
9244,436,2001-06-15,5,"This is an excellant dessert and quite a change from traditional blueberry pie. If you like cold desserts, you'll love this. I added a little more corn starch to thicken it up. Otherwise, its a little liquidy."
13483,7614,2001-11-05,3,"There was absolutely nothing wrong with this recipe.  I just wasn't, personally, that fond of it.  A little bit of icing may have perked it up a bit.  I would still encourage others to try it though!"
4556,10161,2001-07-19,4,"Have used the recipe twice, once as described, using sour cherries entirely.  Will be a great condiment for fowl.  The second I substitued fresh and dried ground ginger for the allspice.  Equally good and distinctive."
5265,3603,2001-01-24,5,"This is a great recipe, tasted just like the wings you would get in the restuarant.  The recipe was very easy."
5465,3603,2001-01-29,5,This a great recipes.  All of my guests loved it and asked me for the recipe.  I highly recommend it.
7819,3603,2001-04-09,4,"This was a BIG hit at a Couples Bridal shower I gave. The guys all kept saying, I know these from somewhere to you order these...it was so funny to see the wives faces when I told them where the recipe came from, I think I might have gotten a few of them in trouble...lol."
21734,3603,2001-11-19,4,"GOOD, a big hit at the WWF Pay-per-view party tonight. Not quite the same taste as Hooters, but close enough. I actually duplicated everything by 8 (and made 80 wings), and it worked out great. Only changes are that I made all of the sauce and dry mix at once, and used those as I went -  Obviously I didn't cook 80 wings all at once. I rolled the wings in the flour mixture as I needed them (rather then 'sprinkling' them with flour like the recipe says), and put a ladle full of sauce in each batch of 10-15 wings as they came out of the deep fryer.

Also added some habenero sauce to a few batches to spice them up some more.

Mmmmm...Mmmmm. Great with a few St. Arnold Christmas Ales (dark, sweet ale)"
23424,3603,2001-12-19,5,"These were excellent.  I made about 80 for my company Christmas party, and I got nothing but praise.  I changed the hot sauce slightly.  I made the ratio of butter to hot sauce 1 to 2.  1 part butter to 2 parts hot sauce.  This made it a little hotter, but it still was not too hot.  Adding the flour mixture to the wing was the key.  I coated the wings with an egg wash and hot sauce mixture before dipping into the flour mixture.  This made the flour stick well to the wing.  I also let them sit in the fridge over night, before frying."
14631,4407,2001-11-20,5,"This was a super recipe - it was easy to make and quick to prepare.  I used a whole cut-off chicken instead of just breasts and think that doing so made a jucier dish.  The flavor of seasoned bread crumbs, yogurt, chicken and peaches (I used frozen slices right from the freezer) was outstanding.  My spouse who is a picky eater ate twice as much as usual and complimented me three times!"
22903,13697,2001-11-05,4,I tried this recipe but only had cream of mushroom soup and it was sooo good.  You can even leave out the potatoes and have this on a bun like a burger.  My family loves it.
6357,11103,2001-08-24,5,WOW!!!!
6357,11682,2001-10-09,5,"Nice, good, pleasing to the taste buds:)

I liked the name as well, sounds rooooomanntic!!"
25001,14693,2001-11-29,4,"This is very easy to make & a delightful twist on the old, tired, traditional turkey soup. I spiced it up a bit more with more than was requested amounts of the spices, chili powder & bottled ""Southwest Seasoning"". I used a fair anount of salt & served it with tortilla strips on top. My whol family loved it!"
12657,454,2001-11-26,4,"Very nice recipe, although I substituted black beans with some other kind of beans (I honestly don't know which; I think it might even have been black-eyed peas!)... made it taste just a wee bit odd. Next time, if I can't find black beans (I need to know what it's called in Hindi! Help, anyone?!), I'll just make the recipe without it :)"
9468,526,2001-05-16,4,"The first batch I made I poured out and had a clump at the bottom, which I discovered to be the pectin. But it tasted great! The second batch I mixed better to get the pectin in, and didn't like it near as well. I will be making mine in the future without the pectin. I also added about a teaspoon or so of Irish Cream syrup which was marvelous!
This is a very easy recipe if you have an easy espresso maker."
11044,10404,2001-08-02,5,These probably won't last long in my refrigerator--they are too delicious!
25834,11723,2001-12-10,4,Easy to make and really delisious.  :)
6357,11580,2001-09-11,5,"This was not almost heavenly - it was REALLY HEAVENLY!!!!!
Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!"
21613,11580,2001-10-19,4,"This was very tasty, I used my husband as a guineapig and now the world is going to enjoy.."
18660,7820,2001-10-06,5,We loved this recipe.  We made this with another recipe called Azteca Soup from Recipezaar. A very nice flavorful dish to go with soups.
13483,8503,2001-10-04,4,"Don't let the name fool you.  This is really good and versitile.  I followed the recipe but added my favourite, garlic, and some chopped tomato.  Served it over noodles, served with a salad and called it dinner.  This ""junk"" was good!  Glad you posted it Bruce."
4470,12200,2001-10-01,5,"A straight 5 star recipe.  I used skinless bonless and they turned out moist and very, very tasty. Nice combination of curry and mustard and Tebo, we sure agree on easy ""do it ahead"" recipes.  I love to spend time with my guests and still turn out a tasty meal Thanks Bergy"
17958,10885,2001-11-26,5,"My Mom made this when I was young but was not of greek descent and I now order this when ever possible when I visit my favorite Greek restaurant in Chicago called the Parthenon where I saw the Frugal Gourmet eating once.
I always wished to ask for this recipe but it isn't something I like to do at a restaurant and now I finnally have it and I found it here at Recipezaar.    OPAH !"
4470,4981,2001-12-29,5,"Excellent recipe! I did it in the crockpot and it took only 6 hours on low then I turned it to keep warm and left it there for 3 more hours. I used beer as suggested instead od wine, added 1 1/2 tsp garlic and 1 1/2 tsp hot chili flakes. I had company and everyone loved it . thanks for a keeper.

UPDATE: This is the second time I have made this chicken easy and good!  It only takes about 15 minutes to put together, including sauting the mushrooms and onions.  I substituted Tomatoe Basil soup instead of the Tomatoe bisque. Again ,added some garlic skipped the basil, used beer instead of wine and added some chili flakes.  My company was coming for lunch so I prepared the sauce the night before put it in the fridge,and added the chicken in the AM, turned on to low at 6 AM and luch was served at 12:30. Served with plain steamed rice, Baby carrots & frozen peas, Nutty beans and fresh baked Danish for dessert.  There were no complaints.  Nice and easy luncheon after all the Christmas cooking, Thanks again Zaar"
23728,4502,2001-11-28,3,"The recipie has alot of promise, but it needs some tweeking.  The first batch out of the oven were undercooked in the center.  Next batch I flattend a bit and they came out better,  the third batch I flattend to 3/8 thick and it seemed to work fine. They are very tender and are very attractive as they crack slightly and have a nice light brown hue around the perimeter.

With the texture issues solved solved I would like to work on the flavor as they are a bit flat for my tastes,  and for what I think a Christmas Cookie should be......  I think some ground nut and more extract would be a big help."
25267,14912,2001-12-04,5,Just like what you would get in a 5 star restaurant.
22596,13359,2001-11-05,2,"This recipe needs more details.  I made it in a 8x8 casserole dish, which was too small and I didn't have enough room for layers.  And I assumed ""meat sauce"" meant some kind of steak sauce, like Heinz 57.  I used A1 sauce, and 2 cups was too strong.

I thought the recipe was bland and not worth the trouble."
15385,11289,2001-10-17,5,For years I ve been an addict of putanesca pasta but I tried your recipe over mine and I was so suprise....... they are perfect .... thank you
5568,2988,2001-03-01,5,i browned the ground beef and then mixed everything together in the croc pot and let it simmer for about 2-3 hours. it was wonderful!!
10314,2988,2001-10-11,5,"I have tried many Chili recipes and this one was the best.  I did not do the blender thing but it still turned out wonderful!!!! I added extra spices to make it hotter, but the consistency and flavor were excellent.  I would give it a try!!"
22642,13139,2001-11-02,4,Yummy! but a bit bland. Good texture otherwise. Could have maybe done with more chocolate chips or none at all.
6183,4882,2001-03-03,0,My recipe is similar...using a whole chicken instead...and slightly different ingerdients..but the major difference is that I make a small dumpling instead of the noodles....
19799,4882,2001-12-28,4,"This is a very good recipe.A bit long to prepare,but well worth the effort."
17608,13921,2001-12-06,5,"This turned out to be a great ""Secret Santa"" gift for the girls at work.  I used Chocolate Fudge Cake, Chocolate Fudge pudding and cocoa for my glaze.  I made one to test it out and I was surprised!  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you..."
6357,8844,2001-08-21,5,"Easy, delicious and wonderful!"
20165,12122,2001-10-07,2,"Saying ""bake pork like you normally would"" is not nearly descriptive enough.  I need a recipe because I don't know how to cook a pork butt!"
19956,9298,2001-09-27,5,"You can also put it back in the icecream container and freeze it, than eat it with apple pie"
6220,5031,2001-06-11,4,It needs another T each of Cayene and Garlic but 1 T less Oregano (unless you use Mexican Oregano) and 3 T less salt(anybody thet wants more can add it later.)
12031,7109,2001-07-05,3,"While the potato salad is good, the recipe makes more than the serving size suggest."
14059,10144,2001-08-10,4,Excellent job. I use almonds instead of the white chocolate. You do have to be really careful about the cooking time...
5355,10144,2001-12-06,5,"Two things:

I added 1/2 cup sugar.  It was good idea.

Also, I used my Airbake cookie sheet with cooking spray, and I had no trouble with overbaking OR removing them from the pan. It did take longer for them to ""crisp"", though.

These were great.  I'm making them for Christmas gifts!"
24801,14208,2001-11-27,3,"Tasted good. Easy to prepare. Didn't thrill the kids, and it looked ""weird"".
I'd rather have a real potato french fry.
Thanks anyway"
16666,11732,2001-09-23,5,"this is very good and so easy to make and you can add cooked left over meat, or roast beef and a salad. take this to a pot luck dinner and you won't have any to take home"
13483,11732,2001-10-17,5,This was a complete dinner.  I did not add salt as I thought there was enough with the soy and onion soup and I added a couple splashes of tabasco.  With tortilla and salsa it was a great meal with left overs for fried rice tomorrow.  Thanks for the recipe
12875,11732,2001-10-19,5,Mikey you done good.  My entire family loved this rice.  It makes alot and its a good thing cause alot is what they ate.  I love any thing with oni0n soup in it.
20776,13267,2001-11-10,4,This is great!  I plan on making this for the holidays.  Although the rum was a bit much!  I made the drink again the next time with about half the rum called for and it was perfect.
17803,13267,2001-11-23,4,"Excellent!  Everyone enjoyed this drink and I had several request for the recipe.  Yes, it does make a large batch, so some of you may want to cut the recipe in half."
24876,13267,2001-12-19,5,"I have been using this recipe for years and it is GREAT for everyone in the family. 
It is just as sumptuous without the Rum as it is with, so the children, the pregnant,
and the teatotaler can toast the new year in with the rest. Thank you much for
having this in your collection."
22015,13267,2001-12-26,5,"I had never had Hot Buttered Rum before, but this was so rick it was decadent!  I am going to keep the mixture in my freezer all winter!  We made both alcholic and non-alcoholic drinks and everyone gave it a thumbs up!"
10701,606,2001-07-23,4,"I made this in slow cooker, crock pot. Just put all in crock pot leaving out butter & using cornflour instead of flour, Only used 2 oxtails and less stock. Cooked it all day on low then skimed off fat. Boy did we love it.  X Kiwi."
14386,10839,2001-11-30,4,"These were so good.My kids love them dipped in milk or hot chocolate after school.I have a batch in the freezer also,am going to put them in jars and give as Christmas gifts with other varieties of biscotti."
4470,588,2001-08-21,5,This recipe is heavenly!  We all enjoyed it and my guests would not leave if I didn't share the recipe with them.  Thankyou for a recipe I will.enjoy many times over.
23621,11263,2001-12-03,4,I found this recipe quick and easy to make. I served it with pancakes and ice cream. Absolutely delicious! Thanks Amy.
10802,11546,2001-09-28,5,This was excellent on sourdough toast.
20828,8826,2001-10-30,0,"It's a great drink alright, I have been indulging in this fine drink for most of my life and I am 77.  You should have heard the Andrews Sisters' rendition of ""Drinking Rum and Cola"" during WarII.

Warren"
9808,9458,2001-06-18,5,"This is a great recipie!  I have been using this same recipie for years.  It's hard to believe that the cucumbers stay crisp after they have been in the freezer.  For those of you who like creamed cucumbers, just drain a little of the juice off and add salad dressing.  Mix and enjoy! (I usually don't let mine set for 72 hours, overnite works just as well)"
14909,9458,2001-09-10,5,I just completed the 3 day freezer pickles and they taste great!  Easy as beans to make.  Now I have a recipe for my cucumbers out of my garden that just do not get used fast enough!
21618,9458,2001-10-24,5,These are JUST like Mother makes.  Very Good.
6164,15960,2001-12-19,0,The recipe seems very heavy on all the unwanted things like saturated fat and cholestrol and all. Wonder how it will support a person having the same in either morning or night !!!
25182,9941,2001-12-03,5,"This is a very nice soup. I make it with pork chops..(3-4) by boiling them also, instead of ham.
I also add a few chopped green onions.
It is very easy to make very tasty."
8337,8603,2001-06-15,5,"This is a fantastic recipe -- only one bowl required, 
and you can mix it with a spoon!  (Those are my
criteria).  One note -- I mix the dry ingredients
together before adding them in order to avoid
soapy baking soda clumps."
11589,8603,2001-06-25,5,It was yummy and easy fer a redneck like me to make...
18650,8603,2001-10-01,5,This recipe is great! I substituted 1/2 cup of oats for 1/2 cup of flour and truned them into Easy Banana Oat Muffins. Yummmmmmmmmm. :)JB
10216,3504,2001-11-12,5,"I sub gelatine for a tsp of Agar-Agar, wich is an algae based gellifying agent. This is even better if you make a chocolate mousse and then put this on top...layered in a glass ramekin, looks great!"
16140,10804,2001-09-21,5,"Lovely biscuits,they were gone as soon as they cooled down!So I,ll be making more!"
21694,5396,2001-11-25,4,This was really good.  The only thing I didn't like was the fish sauce.
9869,9742,2001-12-16,4,"Lovely flavours, I used scotch fillet steak.
Thanks for posting  =)"
19799,14566,2001-12-03,5,"This recipe is fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!I made it this morning to go with sausage gravy,and we all ended up eating just the biscuits.The only thing I did different was to triple the recipe.And they turned out huge and fluffy with great flavor.Definately a recipe that will be used by my family over and over."
18143,13148,2001-11-06,4,Cut down on the salt and it's not to bad...Good flavor.
24841,14189,2001-11-27,0,I have made this recipie for years but added the anisette only to the icing sugar.  I have also tinted tne icing and added sugar sprinkles(multicolored or red and green)at Christmas time for a festive look to my cookie trays. These cookies look especially pretty when made at Eastertime and dedorated and iced in pastel colors.  They also freeze well without icing and can be defrosted and iced at a later time.
22278,989,2001-12-23,4,"It was quick and easy, but there was not enough of the ""dough"" to cover the peaches.  I had to adjust the recipe with more flour,"
22015,10322,2001-11-14,5,"I love this recipe and had lost it.  Thank you so much for posting it.  For those who have never tried it, you don't really taste the kraut but it is esential to this recipe.  Thanks again for posting."
6357,11365,2001-09-04,5,"I can't thank you enough for sharing this recipe.
I love mushrooms and green onions also, thanks so much for such a splendid delight!"
16140,11365,2001-10-01,5,Absolutely Delicious!I served them as a side dish with some grilled line fish.
4379,6547,2001-01-16,3,"Apparently I got the wrong pork chops for this receipe!!!  I only cooked for 1 1/2 hrs and they were way to dry...if I had cooked for 2 they would have been hockey pukes!!!  The taste was good, but I would diffently watch the time and cooking of the chops. Maybe just an hour, covered."
5420,6547,2001-01-27,2,"Why do you have to bake pork chops,this is a B.B.Q recipe. Depending on the size and the amount of time to marinate,they shouldn't be more than 15-20 minutes on the B.B.Q"
4374,930,2001-01-08,4,Very simple to make. there were no strange ingredents or a big mess. taste justlike my moms. very down home
8629,930,2001-07-28,4,"Very good recipe.  They had a nice, thick consistency.  I would recommend this recipe."
12234,933,2001-07-24,4,"My kind of cooking, easy and delicious, I doubled the recipe and used 1 can tomato soup and 1 can crm of mushroom. I also added gr. beef.  Definitely a keeper!"
6357,9996,2001-07-06,0,"Methi is very good for health and curd has a cooling effect on the body.
This roti is enjoyed in India generally in the winter months."
8310,2462,2001-06-16,5,This is a good quick meal to have in a hurry.  I slice my potatoes.
19799,2462,2001-12-23,5,Can't go wrong with this recipe.I've yet to meet a person who will turn these spuds down.
8032,8524,2001-04-09,0,"This is a very easy recipe to make. Everyone loves it. It's even good cold. All you need is a salad and you have a complete meal. Thank you ,mary ann davis"
7422,8524,2001-05-21,3,This recipe is simple to make and flavorful but I found the cornchips became very mushy with the liquid on it.  I did add black beans (drained) to add additional color and protein to dish.
4309,6793,2001-01-03,4,This recipe was easily adapted as a sugar free recipe--substituting Nutrisweet for sugar--My diabetic husband loved it--Thank-you
14386,9007,2001-08-23,4,This is also very good if you substite a can of Rotel(canned tomatoes with peppers)for the tomato puree and the jalapenos.Easier too!
9441,9007,2001-08-29,0,I have never heard of Rotel.  I will be sure to look for it!
20893,9007,2001-10-15,4,"I agree with substituting with Rotel.  Also, try adding 1 regular can of Cream of Mushroom soup with above ingredients (enhances taste and richer flavor)."
21487,9007,2001-11-16,3,"Like the others I make this with the ""hot"" Rotel.
also, I melt te cheese and other ingredients in a crockpot and just put the crockpot out so the dip stays nice and hot the entire time! ""Great football food""!"
5929,4369,2001-11-02,5,"absolutely wonderful, a nice change from the canned. I substituted the almonds with pecans (chopper) and added some dried chopped apricots, and raisins. and an apple it turned out just as tasty as the original recipe, with just a bit of difference."
18679,4369,2001-11-09,5,"I added approx. half a small can of mandarin oranges and a bit of the juice, delicious! I didn't have almonds though."
8118,3828,2001-06-11,4,"This was a tangy, very Caribbean style chicken.  It was a little more work than I anticipated."
22180,7949,2001-11-01,5,"This recipe is my favorite when dining out and this recipe tastes incredible, thanks for sharing it"
15638,4192,2001-08-23,4,Very easy recipe.  Delicious!
27366,2901,2001-12-31,5,"I made this with tilapia, it was wonderful!  Definitely a keeper and very easy!"
5264,5170,2001-01-22,4,"very easy to make,about 5 minutes. the recipe made 9 pancakes 6 inchs round fluffy very light. I was pleased that butter and syrup didn't ""water log"" the cakes. You could add any fruit in this recipe. Overall these were the best I've ever made.  thank you dansa111"
6566,5170,2001-07-23,5,Have used the recipe several times. Grandkids love them!
21656,5170,2001-11-05,5,I made these pancakes this morning for the family and they were great! I found them to be light and cakey. I think the melted butter is what made them so delicious. I'll be using this recipe from now on. Thanks Bill. :)
14834,5170,2001-12-25,5,I am a new cook and the pancakes were easy and wonderful.   Jim
13483,13368,2001-12-13,4,Really good and simple to put together.  I did not have any almonds so I chopped up some mixed nuts and used them.  Worked well.  Will do this again.
18038,10415,2001-09-10,5,Very close to Shrimp here in Acapulco.
14613,10415,2001-10-29,4,Pretty good and you can use the leftover sauce to flavor steamed vegetables.
22820,10415,2001-11-17,4,Delicious preparation for shrimp....goes well with stuffed mushrooms and a glass of red wine!
21694,10415,2001-11-20,3,"Pretty good, but next time I would peel and devain the shrimp.  And maybe cut down on the lime juice."
21752,14149,2001-11-18,5,"We're a big marzipan-eating family, my daughter Adiya is addicted to the stuff and would rather have a bar of marzipan than any other chocolate bar on the market.  I've bought some high-quality marzipan, but it's amazing the difference home-made makes!  This recipe lends itself to shaping very well, and you can make as much or as little as you like.  We left out the brandy and added more vanilla, and my daughter had a wonderful time with some of her friends making flowers and animals for a class project."
10594,4770,2001-06-05,1,missing rice stick noodles snd dipping sauce. Dipping sauce: Hosin with peanut oil garlic and toasted onions with crushed peanuts
20396,4770,2001-10-03,3,"I think this recipe works better with prawn,  prawn and pork, or just pork.  Dipping sauce is definitely necessary, a vietnamese style peanut dipping sauce is best."
13483,10567,2001-10-25,5,"Excellent dish.  I had 1/2 lb ground turkey so I used that with 1/2 lb ground beef, added some liquid smoke and tabasco and served it with tortilla's.  Made a very filling and excellent dinner.  Thanks."
18170,8724,2001-09-04,0,"OOPS!!  There is no oven setting with this recipe, am going to make it and figure 350f 
would be correct. Let you know what I think of it....Thanks, Jo C."

17803,3902,2001-12-26,4,"Another winner!  I was concerned about the lemon taste with making the gravy, but there was no problem.  The gravy made from the drippings tasted just fine.  I was going to squeeze another half of lemon over the turkey when it was half way done, but forgot."
10275,8997,2001-05-29,5,"this is a fantastic dinner,lunch or a last minute solution to the familys hunger problems. i am very happy for the person who put this recipe on here thank you."
11044,9456,2001-07-05,5,"Very delicious and easy to make. 
I will cut back on the brown sugar next time."
20458,9456,2001-10-04,5,"I thought this was delicious, and so easy to make. It was a big hit at our party and so addicting. Excellent recipe!"
9869,9456,2001-11-01,4,"I really liked it too, but will also cut back on the sugar next time."
20371,9503,2001-10-17,5,"Ahhh, Watergate Salad! This is absolutely delicious and one of my family's favourites. None of the kids (my son, his cousins, etc) like nuts though, so don't be afraid do leave them out. This is excellent without them."
19799,9503,2001-12-28,5,"My mom made this stuff when I was a child also.My mom quit making it and I had forgotten all about it.Thank you!!This stuff is yummy,makes me feel like a kid again."
21694,13919,2001-11-14,5,Absolutly fabulous!  I scaled it done a bit though!
20754,14596,2001-11-25,4,"I made this for Thanksgiving and it was delicious!
I don't usually make cheese balls but I will be from now on!"
23027,11012,2001-12-29,5,"excellent, cooked in cast iron skillet and served with Nanny's tomato soup #11121. very moist. Didn't have green onions so I used the regular white onion, but the green would have made it better looking."
10896,8691,2001-06-26,5,"This was amazing, soft as butter and delicious. I served it to some close friends and it was a hit!"
14613,4032,2001-10-29,5,"This is very tasty. I get requests to make this soup all the time now. I made the butternut squash version, adding a ton of dried spices: paprika, basil, oregano, sage, parsley, etc."
20371,13608,2001-11-25,5,"This recipe produced moist, tender pork chops with a tasty sauce. My chops were thin so I didn't bake them the full hour, and I forgot to buy mushrooms, but tinned sliced mushrooms were a good substitute. I served it with rice and broccoli and will definitely be making this dinner again."
25389,13608,2001-12-11,4,Very easy to make and very tender and taste. Buy the pork chops 1 1/2 inch thick.
10216,14248,2001-11-18,5,"mmmmmmmmmm....chocolate...drooooollll.... I have an annoying habbit of adding more chocolate than a recipe adds for, but I think this one covers it *LOL* great!"
6357,14248,2001-11-25,5,"Yummy! I made this on Nov 24th'2001 for my brother's b'day party. Everyone freaked out on it. It's delicious! I garnished it with blanched and chopped almonds and red glaze cherries. Besides that, I cut it into 2 halves in the middle so as to have 2 cakes and then, spread a layer of Lali's Homemade Chocolate Pudding on one cake and covered it with the other. Then, on top of this one, I put some more of her pudding. It was ""YUM""! I clicked a snap too so as to remember how much I LOVED this cake. ""This is her gift to me"", my brother says:)"
6127,2901,2001-07-02,5,"I have made this recipe several times, my Family enjoys it very much, But I also add 1/2 of an Egg Plant cut in srips 1 carrot & one celery diced."
10314,2901,2001-07-13,5,Very easy to make and tasted great.  I will definitely make it again.  The fish has so much flavor.  Yumm!!!
14613,10661,2001-10-29,5,Very nice blend of flavors. I omitted the almonds and it was great.
13041,6971,2001-07-23,5,best and easiest reipe for bread and butter pickles i've ever used! crisp and tasy when opened
13347,6971,2001-07-28,4,"This recipe is almost like the one and I have made for at least 30 years.
It was handed down to me from my grandmother...To add to this recipe
I add 2 green and 2 red peppers sliced thin also...While heating, add several
cloves of garlic...I also process in a hot water bath for at least 10 min. just to be 
on the safe side....I have taken several ""blue ribbons"" with this recipe."
16777,6971,2001-08-29,4,Great recipe to make with all the cucumbers growing in the garden
4470,8584,2001-11-12,5,"Love Lamb Love this recipe!  I added 6 carrots for extra color, thanks for a really good recipe cheers Bergy"
18879,7565,2001-10-23,5,Excellent pie. Didn't think it would work out - but it was fabulous! The ginger is what pulls it all together.
4317,4429,2001-01-05,3,This is a traditional way of making english bread pudding - but i live in Texas - does anyone know what they call suet in Texas? someone told me they only use it for birdseed???
5766,4429,2001-03-07,0,Suet is the fat that our mothers used to get with the stew beef . You need to grind it up to go in the bread pudding.
19799,9114,2001-12-28,4,The flavor was good but it seemed kinda runny.Next time I will add more potates to use up the sauce.
7683,5471,2001-04-03,1,"The recipe is easy to make, preparation is simple, but wasn't really for my taste buds.  I am usually not a picky eater, but something about this didn't work for me.  Hope you have better luck with it!"
5357,4734,2001-01-24,5,"This is the best way to serve shoepeg corn there is...we make the same recipe but use two cans of the shoepeg corn, and no beans.  It's yummy for Thanksgiving."
5988,4734,2001-02-22,5,"Although we double the corn and green beans, it still comes out the same - fantastic.
Take it quite often to covered dish luncheons and dinners.  Always asked for the recipe."
17088,4734,2001-11-14,5,this is a great recipe...I also omit the french style green beans and double the shoepeg corn..I plan to use this recipe in the future! thanks much for sharing it!
18660,3614,2001-10-15,4,"The soup is very filling and tasty with a Tex-Mex attitude. I used 1 can of beef broth and 1 can of vegetable broth for the base. I substituted cilantro for the fresh basil (my fresh basil was NOT so fresh). This recipe went well with Mexican Shrimp Cocktail as an appetizer.  If you like Tex Mex, you'll love this!"
14059,10440,2001-09-07,5,"Good recipe. Try adding some shrimp during the simmering time. I also tried it with Rotini pasta. Holds on to the sauce better, I think..."
19842,10440,2001-10-02,5,Very good and very easy.
23982,10440,2001-11-18,5,"This was an amazing dish! One of the best I have ever made!
I couldn't find the sun dried oil packed tomatoes at the store so I just bought fresh tomatoes and cut them in half and then squoze out the juice like you would an orange and then chopped it and then continued on with the recipe like it said to and it worked out very well. 
If you do not like spicy foods, this probably won't be a favorite, but if you do, MAKE THIS TODAY!"
12200,10020,2001-07-10,0,This recipe is the geatest.  So easy and what a flavor.  If you like cherries you got to try this.
15104,10020,2001-09-18,5,It is easy to make and very good.
17344,3285,2001-09-06,5,"A very big hit in my house where my children are very finicky eaters! 
I substituted the 1 lb of chicken thighs and used 3 pounds of chicken breast instead, since I was upping the recipe for 7 people.
I would have preferred it to be a little more spicy, but my kids thought it was great as is.
I also cooked it for eight (8) hours on low, instead of the 4 at high, so I could start it before I left for work.
I also served the leftover portions over rice with much success."
21432,3285,2001-11-27,5,"Tastes great! It had a little too much meat for us, so next time I'm going to put more vegetables in, and see what it tastes like with potatoes."
17803,4895,2001-11-23,3,Very easy and fun to make.  I forgot cranberries popped when boiled.
19799,13404,2001-12-28,4,Easy to make with good flavor.I added about half a pound of melted velvetta so the kids would eat it better the second time I made it.Gave it a extra kick that pushed it into a company's coming for dinner dish.
13483,10382,2001-09-28,3,I love garlic and ginger.  It would probably have been good with just that.  Even with low sodium soy it came out too salty for me.  Next time I'll use either water or stock with a small amount of soy.
21487,10382,2001-11-26,5,"I for one love was thrilled to see this recipe! These are the best...thank you!
(Any chance you know how to make the chiken that you wrap in aluminum foil squares...also quite tasty but I haven't been able to find a recipe. I can only find paper chicken which doesn't seem exactly the same). Again, thank you for this one, we'll be having it again tonight!"
5523,1229,2001-02-12,4,This looks good. My grandkids will love me. thanks.  :>))
22140,3977,2001-11-01,5,"Very tastey and really easy to make.  I added some cajun seasoning to satisfy my families
taste.  I will surely make this again."
16140,9209,2001-09-23,5,One statement for this salad.Delicious!
20571,4582,2001-10-06,3,"first of all wild boar is not that hard to get.
if you remove the bone it dries out a lot more and the bone gives it more flaveo"
2178,9178,2001-08-21,5,"this stuff is like candy to me. feta, cucumbers & olives are a great combo and the cucumber dressing is just delicious."
5965,3516,2001-02-25,5,This is a great recipe....It didn't take too much time to prepare and the final results were delicious!
7619,3516,2001-04-09,0,This took me about 15 minutes to prepare and about 20 minutes to cook. It turned out really well!  The only change I am going to try is to add a little sugar to the sauce.
11739,3516,2001-06-25,4,"If you want this to be the ""crispy general tsos"" just let the sauce thicken, and then add the well browned chicken at the very last minute before you pull it off of the fire. Great Stuff - less cornstarch!"
14498,3516,2001-08-15,5,"I made this with shrimp, and had to substitute baslamic vinegar instead of rice vinegar - it was very good, just make sure you don't overcook the shrimp.  

Who the heck was General Tsao (Tso), anyway?"
25340,3516,2001-12-04,4,For the novice cook I found this to be a great one.  The ony thing I did different was to add 1/2 cup sugar. Everyone who tried it wanted more!
13483,7085,2001-10-05,5,What a great recipe!!  I love different ways to serve vegetables.  I used linguine in this and it worked fine.  I also cut the broccoli cooking time in half as I like broccoli really crunchy.  Terrific!!
12657,7085,2001-10-22,5,"This one was excellent! Incredibly easy and tasty. I used fusili, and black sesame seeds... the contrast made for really good presentation :-)"
5203,2752,2001-01-19,4,"This recipe makes a 2 pound loaf. I used the white bread setting (3 hrs). The loaf was beautiful, texture was good. The only thing was my machine destroyed the cherries ( I added them as stated in recipe)."
11697,7237,2001-07-17,1,This recipe didn't work for me.  I question only 1/3 cup of flour.  The directions were confusing too.
14583,4018,2001-10-28,4,"carrots need to be put in long before the last 30 mionutes of simmering.... still hard,  and potatoes if used should be put in about and hour before finishing up.... have cooked this low sodium soup three times already and found the above needed to be added sooner than the last 30 minutes....in fact had it tonight for dinner..... 
good luck with my change"
25441,16350,2001-12-31,5,What a heck of an idea!  Will try this one out for New Years Eve and am sending it email to a friend who'd be interested.  Just happen to have some Southern Comfort and now have a new way to high-octane it!
15572,10297,2001-12-28,4,Super way to use leftover turkey.  Sprinkle on a handful of dry roasted peanuts for crunch.
16459,11402,2001-10-03,5,"I really liked this. The simple yet rich taste of olive oil and garlic are two of my favorites. The breadcrumbs added a nice texture to the dish.  I keep thinking about this recipe. Maybe I'm wierd. This recipe is different from the ordinary pasta recipe, but it is just wonderful. I put lots of garlic in it and I added extra olive oil. Next time I make it I will probably cut the bread crumbs down to 3/4 cup. But I just have to reiterate, this dish stays on your mind. Good Job Paula"
13483,11402,2001-11-09,4,The simplicity of this dish can't be beat.  It was a really good dish.  I agree that olive oil and garlic can stand alone and be a great base for a sauce.  I still would like a bit more of a sauce.  Even a small can of tomato paste and some wine would have picked it up I think.  But it sure is a good recipe to build on.  Glad you posted it.
10649,11402,2001-12-05,3,"I love garlic but, I found that it dominated the taste a bit too much. I would suggest adding a bit of ginger in place of about half the garlic."
14532,3020,2001-08-23,0,I can't make this until I find out what the heck is a patty shell.  I only know about pie shells.  I was looking for pattypan squash recipes in the first place and this recipe came up.  It sounds goood and I would try it if someone would tell me what a patty shell is?
12200,10086,2001-07-09,0,You have to try this recipe....
9869,10332,2001-08-03,4,"Tasty family meal..I have a picky 17 year old son..cleaned his plate...lol
=)"
21694,7513,2001-10-22,5,Very creamy and good.
20469,9817,2001-10-04,3,A lot like the ham and cabbage stew that's been passed down in my Irish family for generations. Only we don't use the herbs...just lots of salt and pepper. Definitely a good use for leftover Easter ham.
22898,15147,2001-12-05,5,"We had this soup over the weekend, and it was delicious.  I agree that it is better on the second day.  It can be used as a soup course or as a meal with a salad and fresh baked bread."
4740,9842,2001-07-16,5,"This recipe is absolutely fantastic.  It not only tastes great, but it couldn't be simpler or faster to put together.  Even people that don't normally like refried beans gobble this up.  It's a keeper!"
20429,9842,2001-10-29,5,When I served this at my party all my friends ate it up! I really liked it too.!
21694,14070,2001-11-20,5,"This is a great dish.  It is healthy, easy, quick, and so delicious."
9121,14070,2001-12-04,5,Delectable.
7209,4051,2001-03-29,4,"This makes a lovely chocolate chip cookie, but I couldn't taste the Grand Marnier.  Perhaps adding a bit of orange zest would enhance the orange flavor."
20160,15886,2001-12-25,5,This is the same recipe I have - I must make 15 batches and give as hostess or gift toppers.  It is the best.
12678,10150,2001-07-16,4,Very easy to make and great to freeze for popsiciles
1634,11641,2001-09-16,4,"A very easy, but nice way to make dumblings, that just might encourage the new cook to put away the can opener for awhile."
5385,8531,2001-01-27,3,"Be aware that this is the EXACT recipe that is printed in the booklet that comes with a new crockpot.

It's easy enough, but they call for too much flour, it's a little pasty-tasting to me.  Luckily, I made a test batch before I cooked for guests or I would have been embarrassed.  

Cut the flour amount down to about 1/2 and add more pepper.  I've found that browning the beef first seals it and makes it taste better."
5597,8531,2001-02-04,4,"This recipe is great! Tastes good, is easy and can't beat the convenience of coming home to a meal already to eat. I didn't have any worcestershire sauce and skipped the paprika,it still turned out yummy. I had to have carrots instead of the celery though and a loaf of french bread to go with. mmmmmm."
13748,8531,2001-08-10,0,cut down on flour and brown the meat first
23913,14477,2001-12-18,5,This is a very good recipe the beef turns out so tender and it has good flavor along with the noodles I tried another one of her recipes and it was also a five start rating so I decided to try another and again another 5 star hope to see more recipes from you.....
16119,12496,2001-10-24,3,Yummy and can be made with endless variations.
5060,12496,2001-11-05,4,"These were very tastey, but we found them much too oily, if I do them again, I would use a quarter of the oil,(I spread them on paper towel), but you are right they are very awful to have to often, we will keep them as a treat. Thanks Dorothy"
18745,12496,2001-11-08,1,"I thought these would be very good but I'm sorry to say they were not.  Way, way to much oil and they were not seasoned enough.  I may try the method again but not this recipe.  Sorry"
19585,11949,2001-10-05,4,"This was really good, I served it with fries and fresh asparagus...the only thing was that we found it very salty!  So next time I would make it with onion powder instead of onion salt.  The ""juice"" for the mushrooms provides lots already!"
2178,14458,2001-11-28,4,"Very good, but a bit TOO boozy for me. Next time, I'd make it with 1/2 to 3/4 cup of whiskey. But I used (Maker's Mark) bourbon rather than Canadian rye whiskey, maybe that makes a difference? And the next day it wasn't nearly as boozy, so if you plan to serve it a day later, keep it at 1 cup and you should be fine.

Our dog also got to it soon after it cooled and ate a good 25% of it. He seemed to love it (""Two Duclaws Up!""), but was lying on the kitchen floor fast asleep not too long afterward, not able to hold his liquor."
20371,14458,2001-11-29,0,"Troy's point is excellent. U.S. alcohol is stronger than Canadian, so I do suggest cutting down the amount of whisky if you're not using a bottle bought in Canada."
19832,10394,2001-10-31,5,"turned out very nice... i didn't bake them quite long enough to get that really crisp effect, but they were very good.  i also substituted pecans for the hazelnuts.  yummy!"
2059,8788,2001-10-03,0,I'm at home visiting my folks and my mom made these cookies and reminded me how good they are!
9869,8788,2001-12-04,5,"Cant buy Crisco here, so I used Chefade.
These really are delicious, molasses isnt something I''d normally have in the pantry either, but had that because of another zaar recipe I''d tried. =)"
13483,13494,2001-12-27,5,I love asparagus.  I used dijon mustard and found it to be fine.  I did this away ahead of time and served it cold with a hot meal.  The hot and cold contrast worked well.  So easy and good.  Thanks again Eve.
5659,7773,2001-02-12,3,"Fairly good recipe. I found that I needed to marinate the shark steaks for 3 hrs, because i used the goerge forman grill to cook it.I also found that adding 1 1/2 Tbsp. of sugar(for 2 servings) balances the acidity of this recipe very well..The portions of steak that i cooked were 2 1/2 inches thick and it took me 28 min to cook on the george forman grill.."
4470,15890,2001-12-25,5,"This recipe was part of our Christnas Eve smorgaasbord and was delicious, I put some garlic in it and also a bit of soy. Thanks for a great addition to my favorite recipes."
6357,8525,2001-06-11,5,Great!
24296,3201,2001-11-25,5,I  think  I  will  try  this  one  next  week!!!  sounds  soooo  good.
22151,3525,2001-11-01,5,"this recipe was delicious... actually i didn't freeze the two dishes.  I made one 9x13 size pan of lasagna.  Also, I layered the lasagna in the morning, then refrigerated until time to pop it in the oven that evening and the pasta was tender.  no need to pre cook it.  I did add a layer of seasoned/browned ground round to satisfy my family."
21694,9875,2001-10-28,5,"Mmm, very good way to prepare asparagus."
10075,161409,2001-05-24,5,"I love this recipe, and so does everyone who has every tried it..Delicious."
6127,9254,2001-07-13,5,My Family enjoyed this very much
17853,9254,2001-09-04,5,"almost the same recipe i have used for years. i add lawry's salt. i also double wrap the salmon in aluminum foil and that keeps the fish from sticking and burning to one layer of foil.

in fact, going to start the bbq now !!!!"
2312,9254,2001-11-13,5,"Simple and delicious.  Important to get a good piece of salmon -- most are, as long as it is fresh!"
15609,10924,2001-10-07,4,"This is very good as a dip for ""Chicken Fingers"".  Maybe it doesn't refrig. well due to the honey and the olive oil?  I could eat my weight in this stuff.  (I know, I know, ""that's a lot of honey mustard"".  Ha Ha)"
21752,10924,2001-10-28,4,This goes really well with steamed artichokes!
21791,11544,2001-10-22,2,"smell was wonderful and taste was great!  one huge problem..it didn't ""set"" like the rest of my james and jellies have.  i even cooked at a hard boil for more than a minute do to past experiences when a minute is definately not enough time at a hard boil...still didn't do it the second batch either..it's gonna make great pancake syrup!!!  my intentions were to give ""jam"" in the gift baskets for Christmas though.  and yes i checked over all the ingredients 3 times for the second batch because i didn't want the same thing to happen again. it did anyways...oh well!  i'm giving a low rating due to it not setting the way it should have."
6357,14229,2001-11-18,3,"This wasn't as delicious as I'd expected. It's just about okie. It was ready in the microwave in 4 minutes. In 5-6 minutes, it was horrible, it's better to stop in 4 minutes only. I whisked it once again after removing it from the oven. Then, I added 3 cups of milk and whisked again.
Then, I kept it in the refrigerator. 
I'm not tooo happy with it. Something's missing in it :("
7813,4957,2001-04-09,5,"This is fantastic.  It is great to start this before going to work.  When you walk into your kitchen, it is as though someone has been cooking in your kitchen all day.

My family loved this recipe.  I doubled it and had enough to put in the freezer for a quick meal."
2595,4957,2001-06-25,4,This could be made ahead and frozen in small packets for people like me who live alone and need to pull something together fast.
20827,4957,2001-10-09,5,"this receipe was simple and incredibley delicious.  As mentioned before, just start in the morning and when you get home you have perfectly cooked and seasoned chicked.  Great for enchiladas, burritos, taocs, what ever!!  Try it!

Vicky"
13593,4957,2001-11-06,5,Delicious and easy.  Versatile recipe that can be used for many dishes.  Thank you for sharing.
7108,4957,2001-12-15,5,Very easy & smells wonderful.  I served it in a soft tortilla shell with all the fixings; with a side of Lipton Spanish Rice. I also used Old El' Paso Low Sodium Taco Seasoning & it still tasted great.
16140,11212,2001-09-25,4,"Lovely way to serve Zucchini,its nice to able to prepare in advance so you can just pop it in the oven.I did substitute the green pepper for Red and half the chedder for a blue cheese(alocal on e here in S.Africa)just for a variation."
9441,8424,2001-10-15,4,"This is a yummy recipe!  I added just a dash of flour to the apple mixture, to keep apple juices a little thicker.  I also found the cooking temp to be a little too high.  My crust was very dark brown after only about 15 minutes.  I reduced the temp to about 350 and it cooked nicely."
18391,8486,2001-10-30,4,good .. but next time i will add more chicken ..
17690,11209,2001-09-04,5,"One of the best potato leek soups I have ever tasted. Easy to make,and it truly does taste gourmet. Served with a good cornbread, it's even better!"
20114,11209,2001-11-05,5,This is very good. I have made Julia Childs' potato leek soup but this one is better! The only thing I changed was I used half and half. I'll be making this a lot this winter.
23302,11209,2001-12-10,5,"This ranks among my very favourite soups!! I made a bunch of it and froze it in 1- and 2-serving portions. To cut down on the sodium content, I used salt substitute instead of salt, and I used homemade chicken stock (almost sodium-free) instead of store-bought cans."
16140,11350,2001-09-21,5,These were nicely moist and chewy.I did add 1/4 tsp of freshly ground nutmeg and cloves to the filling mix.
13483,8733,2001-12-27,4,I added some horseradish and served this on a bed of lettuce with salsa and thrououghly enjoyed it.  Did not bother with the chips!
20895,13464,2001-11-01,0,If you like Rice Dishes this is Perfecto!
27122,13464,2001-12-26,5,I will have this soon!
24231,14630,2001-11-26,0,These potatoes are wonderful!
3253,4877,2001-01-16,2,"This cake didn't rise much.  Also the temperature of 350F. is too high.  The cake burned, possibly because I used a teflon coated cake pan.  I did turn heat down to 325 but the damaged was already done."
21618,11078,2001-10-20,1,Not Impressive
8938,893,2001-05-01,5,My family is from Maryland and always made this pie.  My aunt who passed away was a great white potato pie maker but never told us the full ingredients for her pie.  This one is great!
12200,10240,2001-07-17,0,"This dip is the best, great with fresh apple slices."
4470,12239,2001-10-15,5,Wowwee!  This was fun and no singed eye brows.   I used Asian apple pears (there are a lot of locally grown ones around this year) and they were delicious.  Thanks for another great recipe Dorothy.    Cheers Bergy
2312,12239,2001-12-26,5,"Ok, so I botched the flambe part but it was still delicious.  Also threw half apples and half pears and it still worked!"
5285,1857,2001-01-22,3,"It's between three and four stars, really. Easy to make and good tastin'. It's stick-to-your-ribs stuff, it's like chicken paella, and that's pretty good. I am glad I made it, I will make it again, it will be my lunch for the next three weeks."
15368,1857,2001-11-13,3,"Wow this recipe makes a lot of food.  The oregano and lemon juice were a little overpowering, I would reduce them by half.  When I re-heated some left-overs I added some hot italian sausage that I had pre-cooked - it was a marriage made in heaven!!"
18660,15069,2001-12-15,5,"These cookies were light and flaky, surrounded by a sweet cloud of cinnamon and sugar. I used the food processor method and it was quick and easy.  I'll be making more batches of these cookies."
12714,8968,2001-07-16,4,"Delicious!
My houmous recipe is similar but without the cumin. Always top with extra virgin olive oil; never use vegetable oil (it won''t give the authentic, rich, fragrant middle-eastern taste or fragrance).
For a change: rub pita bread with cut garlic cloves-brush with olive oil-toast in oven until crispy and cut into triangles.  Or just scoop it up with non toasted pita.
Serve with olives-middle-eastern, small green ones, if you can find them (Atlantic Ave.,Brooklyn, NY, or in a city with a large arabic population, look for an Arab grocery).
Or, try Nichoise olives (French, small black)."
12078,9206,2001-07-02,5,"This recipe is just wonderful. You can use any flavor of cake mix and pudding mix, I have made chocolate, cherry, and lemon. They are very easy to make. They turn out with the big tops just like the ones you buy. I always make mine in the large muffin tins. I have used this recipe over and over, my friends and family want to know where I buy my muffins."
19120,9206,2001-09-14,5,My family really sove this recipe. How ever when I make it we come out with 20 standard muffins.  My children like to help make it.
22571,2531,2001-10-31,5,this is cool 4 halloween partys
18014,9162,2001-11-14,4,This was sooo good!  Made it for a luncheon with friends.  Easy to make especially with a one year old running around!
10923,7385,2001-06-11,4,"Good, though I reccommend not including the beans
(personal taste issue)

Cheers,
Geoff"
4470,9858,2001-07-23,0,"I am a guest in Bergie""s house and last night was served a really great dinner! This lamb recipe BBQ'D served with new potatoes, minted fresh peas, new carrots, baked onions and topped off with a lemon crunch pie.  What a repast!  It deserves a 5 star rating"
2555,12199,2001-10-30,5,"I made these today and they were so good.  My husband loved them....Tomorrow I'm making more for his office.  By the way, to prepare the pan - do you grease and flour - I did and it worked fine.  Also, baked in little larger pan and turned out fine.

Wanda from Texas"
24392,12199,2001-11-22,5,Verygood
23099,12199,2001-12-03,5,This is a very tasty bar.  It's light and fast to make.  My family really enjoyed this.  I will make this a must for my recipe file.  Happyclip
7903,12199,2001-12-14,5,My friends and family all loved these bars. This is a very easy recipe!
4910,8679,2001-05-30,4,I tried chanterells mushrooms as that was what I had and it was outstanding. Mt guests all asked for the recipe. My wine choice was [ blue moumtain pinot gris 1998]    sharron cant
10216,13111,2001-10-23,4,Looks yummy! I'll try this next time I want a sugar overdose!
9236,2681,2001-07-02,5,hmmmm good  taste like i was at taco bell lol
14911,3626,2001-08-15,5,"I have'nt tried this recipe yet. But from the 
ingredients I can tell how it will taste.

The sauce will go nicely with spaghetti, and a nice red wholesome wine will go  further with it.

The chunks of meat on the bone will go nicely accompanied with french fries and green beans."
7994,3595,2001-04-09,0,I find this recipe hard to follow because im in australia  and need to find similar ingredients.
8061,3595,2001-04-13,5,I made this cake for my wife and she took it to her work and everyone wants me to make one for them.
12200,3595,2001-07-05,5,I have made this cake many times and it is always a hit.  Try replacing the dark chocolate cake mix with German Chocolate cake mix for a less chocolate cake.  It is good also.
4470,7748,2001-07-23,5,"Excellent recipe! I used ""Blue Haki"" fish and it was really good. I love a recipe where you can get it ready in the morning and just put it in the fridge for the day and pop it in the oven at dinner time, especially when you have company staying with you. Thankyou."
16140,7748,2001-09-23,5,Lovely and moist.
13483,3620,2001-11-01,2,This was an interesting recipe but I just did not think the chocolate and ricotta cheese went that well together. It was a bit too sticky as well.
12972,10904,2001-08-15,0,Substitute the ketchup with a medium salsa.
15338,10507,2001-08-21,5,Thank you for this recipe!  I have always wondered how to make good potato pancakes.  I used Bisquick instead of flour and it worked fine.
16788,10507,2001-08-29,5,"My family has also been doing it this way for years, but we use an egg or two, no milk. Also try adding a little oatmeal with the flour (about 1-2T) YUMMY!"
16666,10507,2001-09-06,5,My mother-in law was German add taught me how to make these 40 ye. ago. I make mine with onion and server them with ham and bean soup.
18745,10507,2001-09-10,5,"These were great!! With just a couple of minor alterations they tasted just like my Mom used to make.  I have tried so many recipes before and this one was clearly the easiest and best tasting one I hace ever found.  My Mom would be proud of me, if only I could tell her.  Thanks!"
13736,10507,2001-10-01,5,"Really simple and quick to make. We enjoyed them.
I will adapt to make them more like a hash brown and see how that works. Well done."
17463,10507,2001-10-04,1,"I did not like this at all,I had freinds over so I made somthing easy,no one cared for them."
13483,10507,2001-10-18,4,"I think I'm finished with ""boxed"" mixes.  This was easy to put together and it made a terrific meal with just a salad.  Think next time I may use Bisquick and add a Tbs or two more.  This was not too thin but I like it thicker.  Still a great recipe.  Glad you posted it."
16758,10507,2001-10-30,1,"it is not that good,even the kids were crying they did not want to eat it"
5745,2895,2001-02-13,5,"I haven''t tasted it yet because I''m just trying it for the first time for a family member''s birthday party. I am boiling the pineapple and sugar at the moment and tomorrow, I will put the pudding/cream cheese mixture on it and add the bananas and whipped topping and coconut and cherries. It sounds just marvelous! I intend to put a red transparent g-string on the finished product as it seems quite appropriate! I''m sure it''s going to taste fabulous so I will give it the highest rating! Mahalo for the great recipe and looking forward to more... Aloha, Ijeva
-----I finally baked the cake and changed it to chocolate instead of yellow cake mix.  It is absolutely delicious.  I would however, not put 2 cups of sugar because it is awfully sweet but might reduce the quantity or even substitute with some kahlua and milk instead.

Other than that, my son devoured the rest of the cake.  Superb!"
8111,2895,2001-04-13,5,"This was a vert tasty treat! However, I subsituted the pecans with almond slivers.
I am thinking next time to crush the almond slivers an try it that way."
11768,2895,2001-08-08,5,"Easy to make, moist, delicious!  Perfect summer dessert!"
13667,2856,2001-11-12,5,"Oh MY. I even got a Steak and potato man to go for this. I am german and served with 
bacon bit and roast potato and cabbage(kraut). This marinade too die for. Thank you."
6897,8949,2001-07-25,4,This was delicious!  I ate 'em in two sittings.
14880,8949,2001-11-06,1,This recipe sounded like a great idea.  I tried steaming the collard greens over the stovetop for nearly 2 hours and could not get them cooked enough to taste good.  Maybe I did not do something right?  I am sticking to boiling collard greens from now on.
25222,8949,2001-12-06,5,"These turned out wonderfully.  Simple, clean food."
20754,13144,2001-11-23,4,If you like ginger these cookies are great!  Very crisp!
10404,1293,2001-09-18,5,I loved these!  I grew up on these but never had the butterscotch chips in them.  Yummmmy-thank's for posting.  Diana
21752,15416,2001-12-17,5,My daughters made this last night and I couldn't stop picking at the dough before they formed the balls.  They used finely ground almonds and also added some grated orange rind.  We're going to be making this a lot from now on!
20371,15416,2001-12-22,5,"This sweet treat is a real delight. I left out the nuts due to a family member's request and they taste just great without them. Vanilla wafers come in 250g boxes here in Canada, so I had to use 1-1/2 boxes to equal the 12-oz box called for in this recipe. One important difference: my yield was 76 balls, using my 1-inch scoop. Rolled in coconut, these are terrific!"
17803,15416,2001-12-25,5,"What a blast of orange flavor, excellent!  My girls and I just finished making these, very easy.  I used the larger end of a melon baller to make our tiny bite size cookies.  Sorry Lennie, our cookie count was 157."
12129,9425,2001-07-27,4,Very tasty and fun to make!  I made it with steak and it was a definate crowd pleaser.  The lime gave it a nice zing!
13819,9425,2001-11-30,5,Terrific!!!  Works well with chicken or beef.
17675,8639,2001-09-19,4,Would have liked Almonds on top with sprinkles.Just like my Mother made in U.K. Thanks for reminding me.
23302,8639,2001-12-25,5,"It got the ""Oliver Twist"" treatment and disappeared with lightning speed in my house. Thanks a million - wonderful recipe."
18337,8951,2001-09-06,5,super recipe but I added garlic to it
19043,10970,2001-09-23,2,"This was bland and we like spicy.  I liked the onions on top.  I may try this and par boil the potatoes, they took longer to cook, but I may have overcrowded them.  I may also try some cream of mushroom soup on the potatoes."
18745,16460,2001-12-31,5,This is basically the same recipe I posted under the name Jezebel Sauce.  I is very unusual and extremely tasty. Try it as a dip for ham chunks.
17803,13055,2001-12-26,5,What a festive look on the table for the holidays.  The taste was excellent!  Our German guess enjoyed the cranberries.  (There are no cranberries in Germany.)
7276,2679,2001-03-29,4,"I think this has to be an English soul food:) My Mother is from yorkshire. 
If there are not enough meat fats we always use lard. Put into a hot oven first in muffin pan or a metal pan at 425 till fat smokes.Then add batter helps batter to rise :)"
16863,2679,2001-08-29,5,"I'm from Yorkshire, I still cook Yorkshire Puddings for my American family on a regular basis, my family recipe had approx 1/4 cup of hot tap water added it helps them rise better."
20364,2679,2001-10-02,4,It''s OK
16758,8913,2001-08-29,1,"i have try this soup,i have cut down on the tomato sauce still way to much tomatoe sauce needs a little help"
15662,8913,2001-09-23,3,This is a great recipe for fall & winter meals! Thanks!
18862,8913,2001-10-30,1,"the soup was not that good,i do think something was left out"
5686,400,2001-02-12,5,"The dish is wonderful! It so easy to make, it takes 15-20 min :). Also I like to serve it with butter and sour cream. Everytime I cook Spaetzle my husband ask if there anything is left. Though, I always cook more. Try, and you''ll see how easy and delicious it is!"
10291,400,2001-05-30,1,"As a German National, growing up in the birthplace of Spaetzle in the Swabian community, having had Spaetzle twice a week since I can remember, I have to tell you that Spaetzle are not made with milk. You just use water. In the old days Spaetzles dough was made thinner and put on a cuttingboard then scraped into boiling water. It only takes a couple of minutes..less then 5, for Spaetzle to be done. I actually have a spaetzlesmachine where you fill in the dough and it comes out looking like spagetti, but you stir them up and they break a little, cookingtime is 2 minutes...once they boil take them out. Spaetzlesmachine is much like a potatoricer, there are places on the web where you can buy those. Thats authentic Spaetzle. Sometimes my Mom just made Spaetzle, browned some onions in butter and put them over the spaetzle, serve with a fresh green salad and you got a complete meal."
9869,4044,2001-09-21,5,"These have got to be one of the best cookies I've ever tasted, simply divine!  =)"
6381,8549,2001-05-31,4,"Did not feel like cooking. Happened upon this recipe, and was glad I did. Not only fast. but  easy and very tasty.  I recommend it, especially on those lazy days"
13483,8549,2001-09-04,5,A friend of mine loves ketchup so he loved this (except he covered it with more ketchup!!)  Nice and easy to make and lots of flavour.  Glad you posted it.
4470,12889,2001-10-29,5,"Really  enjoyedf this dish!   I used powdered dry ginger but it was still great. I cut the recipe back because two of us had this recipe and I made a separate  dish with one piece of filet with plain Garlic, Lemon and Ginger. L9ve your recipes Tebo.      Cheers Bergy"
24126,12889,2001-12-03,5,This was a real treat!
24164,45643,2001-11-20,4,I took this to a girl''s weekend away. Everyone loved it. Dipping the apple slices in the lemon-lime soda was a great idea. I liked the taste much better than dipping slices in lemon juice.
24217,45643,2001-11-20,5,I have had this dip at a party...it was awesome!  The hostess served it with tart granny smith apples though--I thik the contrast between the super-sweet dip and the super-tart apples was what made it so yummy.
17608,45643,2001-12-10,5,This recipe was absolutely wonderful.  It was very easy to make and it lets you justify your sweet tooth by being able to eat it with apples.  It is definitely a winner.
23302,14179,2001-12-06,4,"Very good stuff, and just hot enough for my taste. But the ""de-seeding"" routine is a little time-consuming."
8944,6798,2001-05-01,5,"I tryed several recipes of yours. This so far was the best. You can vary the recipe an ways to make it the way you want. It is easy, quick, and the taste is so creamy. The staff loved it. Customers raved about it. Thanks again,chef charles"
9869,14053,2001-11-28,5,"Was a tasty meatloaf, the topping gave it that little 'extra'. The books are good too.  =)"
4470,12455,2001-10-09,5,"I had left over sweet potatoes sOoooooo I used them and I used canned Manderin oranges. I used a 1/2 tsp cayenne.  MMMmmm
Dorothy this is a very tasty dish. I'll do it again
Thanks Bergy"
9869,12455,2001-12-16,5,"Delicious! I used a pork steak and cut the baking time accordingly, very tasty loved the flavours."
7416,8682,2001-04-02,5,"I had lots of time to kill on a sunday afternoon so I tried Pete's recipe and it was well worth the time, good job Pete,Thanks,Dave."
4525,591,2001-01-16,5,"very healthy scone  great web site thank you i, i  have 2 tennage girls so they are into recipes ok thanks once a gain"

27620,14972,2001-12-31,5,"My family went totally nuts after eating these stuffed clams, all I heard was can I have more please!! The recipe was easy, and they turned out moist, tender, and delicious. My family and I thank you Recipezaar."
2312,13619,2001-12-08,5,Did a half and half butter to shortening for a bit more flavor.  Great crust!
6357,12445,2001-10-08,5,"Dearest Lali,

13444,14990,2001-12-15,2,"To simplify this recipe, spread chopped almonds in a layer on the jelly roll pan, then shredded chocolate.  THEN, pour the sugar/butter mixture over.  Thereby eliminating the need to invert the candy...."
6702,659,2001-05-25,3,"Really yummy! I only had Pear Cider on hand, but it was lovely and grilled divinely :)"
18391,13056,2001-11-20,5,Excellent!! 25 mins wasnt enough though .. i broiled it for an extra 10 minutes ...
14386,4425,2001-10-01,1,"This recipe does not work the way it is written.The only way it works is to make the cake batter as directed on the cake mix package,and then mix in the sour cream and extract.Otherwise it is too dry."
10701,9392,2001-06-18,4,"Was verry easy to make as I put it all in crock pot, using just stewing beef cheap cut no fat. Used same wine with 2 turnips, no tomatoe soup.
But used 2 tlbs tomatoe paste. Never browned meat & added my own fresh chilli. Thickend towards end of cooking with cornflour. I think its the best beef stew we haver tried. Thanks Adrienne:
P.S Cooked for 5hrs in crock pot."
7332,5287,2001-08-30,5,"This recipe is sooo easy to make, and its a real hit. Everyone in my house likes soft cookies, and these are the softest.  My favorite flavor of cake mix to use is lemon, but chocolate is good too (they taste like brownies!)"
8377,8627,2001-05-31,4,"The lemon rice was indeed, very lemony. This was really a great rice dish."
15385,10780,2001-09-10,5,"this recipe was so good I couldnt stop eating lol
thanks"
6125,1883,2001-03-12,1,It was very runny and need a little flavor.Much better if you use fresh apples.
10548,4764,2001-07-26,5,"Great cheesecake, I've made 10 of them in 2 months. I change the cream cheese to goat cream cheese and friends always ask for this one.Ihave made it with a gingersnap crust also.I rate this cheese cake a 5 star +. Thank You Nany"
22533,4764,2001-11-20,4,Very easy and delicious!
13747,4764,2001-12-03,4,So simple to make and such a hit at the Thanksgiving table this year!! Definately will become a traditional dish at our house each Thanksgiving!!
1634,10258,2001-09-17,5,"This is a very interesting dish as it is,with a refreshing taste, but it can also provide the creative cook with a base that can be used to add more flavors. I plan to add basil next time."
20037,10258,2001-09-28,5,"I loved this. I used fat free cream cheese though and added ""Hot shots"" it is a red ad black pepper blend."
10216,11513,2001-10-22,5,great stuff...but I used olive oil... I refuse to use anything other!!! LOL... They go nice and crisp but tender inside...very very good!
21752,11513,2001-10-30,5,"I made these last night, and my Brit husband, the self-proclaimed ""Chip King"" loved them.  Instead of dicing the potatoes I kept them in thin strips, and used one HUGE onion instead of a small one.  This one is a keeper!"
24492,13684,2001-11-23,5,"This is so yummy, and its so easy too!! 16 years old?? No way!! :)"
16459,12210,2001-11-08,5,This was fantastic. My kids loved it!
13483,12210,2001-11-10,5,"I loved the lemon and the simplicity of this recipe.  I used frozen blueberries and they worked fine, however, fresh would be better.  Should be fantastic with fresh strawberries next season!!  Thanks again Dorothy."
24217,13751,2001-11-28,5,"Mirjam-Thank you for a wonderful recipe and gift idea!  I am making up baskets similar to what you descibed for neighbors, babysitters and as teacher presents.  My kids also make cinnamon dough ornaments that we will include with the baskets--following the apple/cinnamon spice theme. Also, we will line the baskets with an old-fashioned apple print fabric.  Thanks again!!"
5788,7222,2001-02-12,0,"If you use a can of tomato sauce in place of the soup,and,1/2 can of cider vinegar with 1/2 can water (useing the tomato sauce can), you will have really delicious stuffed cabbage with a zest.

                  Pepper barlow


size tomato sauce- 15 oz.Can"
9746,7222,2001-05-24,0,"This is one that I grew up with, but instead of bread cumbs we used rice, and combined ground sausage with the beef, and lots of pepper. You can also bake this in the oven.  Boil your cabbage leaves, roll the mixture and place in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, cover with the tomato sause/soup."
18977,7222,2001-09-14,5,"I find the easiest way to pre-cook and soften the cabbage leaves is to core the cabbage, then place the entire head in a covered stock pot of boiling water.
After about 4 minutes, carefully lift the head of cabbage out of the pot using 2 large cooking spoons; place on a dinner plate and remove the soft outer leaves.  Again place the remaining head of cabbage back into the boiling water and repeat the process until all the leaves are softened and have been removed.
I bake the cabbage rolls in a 325 degree oven for approximately 2 hours.  This slower cooking permits the flavors to mature and also ensures tender cabbage leaves."
15609,7222,2001-09-23,4,"These were good, however, I do prefer the rice to the bread crumbs. The tomato soup (although I do use tomato soup quite a bit) alone doesn't have enough ""Zing"" for Cabbage Rolls."
21694,13138,2001-11-20,3,This was just OK.  It would have been better without the yogurt.
24481,3476,2001-11-23,0,"I have made this fruitcake many times and always to rave reviews (especially from people who don't like fruitcake) but...I don'tuse fruit cocktail, just marachino cherries (2 small jars- no juice) and when I mix the cakes, I add 1 cup raisins, 1 cup walnuts, 1 cup pecans, and 1 cup coconut.  It's rich but oh so tasty! With all that added, I never frost it."
9347,8970,2001-05-20,0,Easy recipe - couldn't believe how easy. But I found there was too much flour -left out nearly i cup.And tastes great Janice
11455,8970,2001-06-25,0,"if yoy substitute 1/2 cup cake flour for regular flour it will rise higher,  plus if you heat your oven to its highest temp. and use a stone; it will cook in 3 to 4 min and doesn't have to be turned."
10216,2130,2001-10-22,5,"Yey! coconut piramids! I divide the mix into three and add food colour pink, green and blue. 
Also once they have set I like to dip them in melted chocolate and let them set (I just love coconut and chocolate together)."
21752,9121,2001-12-04,5,"Wow, that's all I can say!  I made these last night for a light supper, added paprika and used half cheddar, half Swiss emmenthal.  I brought what little leftovers there were in for lunch today, can't wait!"
6406,8486,2001-03-19,4,I liked this dish but would omit the cloves of garlic. There are so many other flavors going on here that it doesn't need it.
6157,8486,2001-05-15,4,"My hole family loved this recipe.There was alot of chopping for me but I think it is worth it.It is also VERY filling and VERY cheesy,just what my family loves."
14008,8486,2001-08-15,4,very good - i added a small can of coarsely chopped water chestnuts for a bit of crunch.
10332,8486,2001-09-07,5,"I made this recipe tonight, and it was excellent!  I liked all the ingredients in this dish. I wouldn't change a thing.  My son especially liked all the cheese."
15609,8486,2001-09-26,4,"This is very good.  I did not pre-cook the rice. I am a garlic lover and loved the flavor. Kinda ""Garlic Chicken and Rice"".  Mmmm Mmmm!  I think next time I am going to make it without the rice and serve Over noodles. (Just to try and see)"
20361,8486,2001-10-02,5,I traditionally do not like chicken casserole dishes.  This one was excellent.
16618,8486,2001-10-08,5,"I made this recipe 4 times in the last 3 weeks 
it was really a big hit with my family. My son especially loved it beacause he can reheat and eat ... And its very simple and quick."
20964,8486,2001-10-12,3,"I found it a little salty, but that would be easily solved by using a low sodium soup.  I would also recommend that you drain the juice from the chicken before adding the other ingredients, as the final product was quite runny until it was chilled.  I would like to try this without the velveeta as well... if anyone has tried this let me know how you did it.  Serving it with a toasted garlic ciabbatta bun really topped it off."
20929,8486,2001-10-18,5,My whole family really liked this and they are hard to please.  I did use low sodium soup and unsalted butter.  I think its great.  Thanks
19043,11197,2001-09-23,5,"This was WONDERFUL.  The jalapenos gave it a nice spicy flavor and it was really beautiful. There were many different flavors. I would serve this at a dinner party because the presentation was great and they were very tasty. Thanks, I will cook this many times I'm sure."
16695,8486,2001-10-19,5,this was absolutely delicious.
3288,8486,2001-12-10,4,"I really enjoyed this recipe.  I have made it twice for our family so far and everyone loves it.  Since I tend not to worry about fat, I added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the mix to make it even more cheesy!"
8569,632,2001-04-22,5,"These muffins were quick and easy to make, and they were wonderful!  This is a recipe I will definitely make again!"
12585,632,2001-07-16,3,"Right out of the oven the muffins were very good, but when cool, they lost some flavor.  
Maybe some salt would help?"
18977,7262,2001-09-13,4,"This is good ""basic"" recipe, but it needs the addition of FENNEL Seed and RED PEPPER Flakes to make it ""Italian Hot Sausage""."
9082,1246,2001-05-10,5,i only made the sauce for this recipe but it was quite tasty! Very simple and easy to make
17815,11182,2001-09-04,5,This recipe is as easy as it is delicous.I would suggest you too try!!!
17463,11182,2001-09-05,5,holly you are right  this is so good the only thing i did was put peppers and onions in non stick pan an pre cook them  really good
18745,11182,2001-09-13,5,My family really enjoyed this. The Grand Kids were over and they really gobbled it up. Thanks
6406,11182,2001-11-16,5,So easy to make and eat!  I used a large cookie sheet and it turned out great! As good as it promises!  Thanks.
7108,12756,2001-11-09,5,This lemon mustard mix gives great taste to plain old baby carrots.  Next time I think I may add a little more Dijon Mustard & honey.
13483,12756,2001-11-15,5,"Another good one Bergy.  I had some carrots I wanted to use up so I just thickly sliced them instead of baby carrots.  I think next time I'll add a bit more lemon.
Thanks again Bergy"
4470,8437,2001-12-22,5,"Excellent recipe Bill, Thank-you.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 tsp and increased the garlic, I still used one clove but my cloves are very large"
5907,5123,2001-02-18,5,"As a helper of a girl scout troop, one of a projects to earn a badge was to prepare an ethnic meal.  We chose and Italian meal and for dessert we chose these cookies.  The girls really enjoyed making and EATING them.  We got about 5 1/2 dozen cookies from a batch.  Thanks for a really wonderful and delicious recipe."
17608,13366,2001-11-29,0,"I added 2 cups of non-fat dry milk to this mixture when I made my ""jar-gift"" version.  It cuts out the add milk step, now you can just add water.  If you double the recipe, you get seven 8 oz jars of cocoa mix."
23584,13366,2001-12-16,5,I loved this cocoa mix! I gave it to my all my friends for Christmas. It's a delicious cinnamony taste to hot chocolate. Definitely the best mix on this website.
10437,932,2001-09-23,0,"I always mix my dressing ingredients together first before adding to the entire dish.  For instance mix the mayo, salt, pepper, horseradish together first in a small dish.  If you are usign small pieces of onion and celery too then add that in as well,  Then mix all of that with the potatoes.  It spreads all of the dressing ingredients better throughout the salad.  Tastes better faster.  Although it is always better to let it ""sit"" a bit before serving this helps speed up that process."
6357,13366,2001-12-25,2,"Sorry, but I didn't like this. I went upto adding even 5tbsp of this mix in a cup of hot water, but yet, the taste wasn't really nice."
10896,9366,2001-06-11,5,This was great! My guests had 2nd and 3rd helpings.
12619,3711,2001-12-08,4,The Cookies were really good. They were like a shortbread cookie. But I did not use the almonds. I used Fishers nut topping instead. My kids really liked them.
9580,8512,2001-12-04,4,"Thomas, from one quiche eating/making real man to another-----great recipe!"
4470,8626,2001-08-08,5,"Really loved these beans.  I did vary it slightly. Instead of small red onion I used 2 red scallions and I mixed yellow and green beans.
It's great to get fresh bean recipes when the garden won't quit producing them. Thanks"
19481,8626,2001-09-20,5,"I cut the onion by half, sauteed lightly, and used a garlic flavored rice vinegar - DELICIOUS!"
20084,8626,2001-10-17,4,"A nice, fresh taste."
12360,9947,2001-07-30,1,"The peppers were mushy and tasted like just vinegar.  I am new at this, but followed directions?!?!"
13922,9947,2001-08-07,0,I would be interested in knowing why the peppers were mushy and tasted more like vinegar - I am getting ready to pickle banana peppers - thank you.
13937,9947,2001-08-08,2,"I am looking for a recipe for pickled banana peppers, and found this one. What I am having a problem with is the horseradish that this recipe calls for. I have never heard of horseradish in a pickleing recipe. I haven't made this recipe yet and I think I will pass this one up and find another one. But Thank you just the same."
22729,4787,2001-11-02,5,"My husband has been looking for this recipe for years!  

This makes a very light sweet dessert/snack.  They are addictive, so watch out!"
14613,113,2001-08-21,3,"Not all that exciting or flavorful.  Next time I'll add more honey, perhaps use vanilla yogurt or sugar.  Otherwise, they're too bland, even for biscuits."
4564,8417,2001-01-19,5,this is wonderful very easy but i used cooked pudding. has more lemon pie taste
21694,13298,2001-11-08,4,"Very delicous, great during the early fall."
7308,4138,2001-09-07,3,"Because I wanted a lower-fat version, I didn't make the sauce and I used extra lean beef.  Tastes good, but jeez these things are difficult to roll up."
23415,4138,2001-11-12,0,This sounds revolting! Hamburger Helper!?
12299,8768,2001-07-09,5,"not difficult, taste wonderful"
13861,9770,2001-09-20,5,"I've been looking for along time for pancakes just like ""My Old Gran ""use to make and this is it."
23302,9770,2001-11-17,5,"Top these bad boys with Lyle's Golden Syrup or Vermont Grade ""A"" maple syrup. Mmmmm......."
4470,11839,2001-10-01,5,Lali this is indeed a winner.I cooked it Saturday night and I cut the recipe back to one serving it worked beautifully. Also I added more garlic (i'm a garlic freak) and it was just delicious. Thank-you Bergy
19437,11683,2001-09-28,4,The cookies were great......
6357,4174,2001-10-16,4,"I made this today evening. It was nice, however, it could be a little better. The only problem was that the cake didn't fluff up. I presume that it could partly be due to the absence of eggs as this cake is an eggless one. I liked the taste, I must admit. Infact, its 1:40am here where I live, and I am having a small piece of this cake:) Its yummmmm, thank you for sharing the recipe."
22001,4119,2001-12-28,4,Taste good and easy to make compared to some truffle recipes I have made before.
21399,15269,2001-12-07,3,These were very tasty just the way they are but something was missing so I think I am going to try them again but add a bit of spicey mustard to the mayo and maybe include a strip or 2 of crisp bacon.  I have had the KFC twisters when they were selling them here and loved them.
19799,15269,2001-12-28,4,"I made this adding the spicy mustard and bacon,like Karen suggested.Personally,they tasted better than KFC's version."
18990,4433,2001-10-06,2,Sorry to say that this dip was just ok. I may try one of the many others listed but if I don't like that one I won't make this dip again
8631,13398,2001-11-08,4,"We really enjoyed this recipe.  I did use fresh pumkin from Halloween, which meant, I reduced the salad oil to 3/4 cup, 1 2/3 cup of sugar, and I also added more spice along side of the cinnamon - 1/2 tsp of allspice and nutmeg.  The kids really enjoyed without the icing.  Thanks"
21694,13285,2001-10-28,5,"Very good, great for a nice, healthy lunch."
21694,13335,2001-10-28,4,Delicious for a light dinner or lunch.
21752,8790,2001-11-07,5,"What a novel idea to have potatoes in the meatball mix!  I used my regular meatball recipe and added the potatoes.  I boiled them up in a combination of broth and cranberry sauce, and this was a truly superb appetizer!"
9869,14532,2001-12-31,5,"I had plans on making this for our Christmas dinner, but we had been given a lovely ham on the bone so we ate that instead.
Decided to make this delicious pork recipe today for a family Sunday roast.
I used a shoulder roast (bone in) and the meat was the most tender of any I have ever made.
Plenty left for sandwiches tomorrow too, which is a bonus!
Thanks for posting and to anyone wanting a delicious roast give this one a go!"
11119,4414,2001-06-18,3,"I made this as a side dish to a beef casarole.  It needs HEAPS of seasoning, and maybe less onion - my kids don't like onion...hubby loved it.  Easy to make."
21752,4414,2001-11-14,5,"I took Angela's advice, added my own seasonings (paprika and freshly ground black pepper) and it came out great.  This is going to become major comfort food in our house.  You could go the other way, forget about the onions and add some nutmeg, and it will still be good!"
15572,10654,2001-09-10,3,"Try a dash of dark rum, just a little."
16241,6703,2001-08-23,0,"i will try soon!!! i love cheddar....but in italy? can it be found?
Alessio"
6357,12989,2001-12-25,5,"An ""EXCELLENT"" RECIPE! You have to say a special ""Thank You"" to your mom from me for this one. I added some walnuts and almonds too to this.
What I really loved about this recipe is the ""chocolate chips"" part, a bread with chocolate in it, AHHHH!! 
Thank you, I'm enjoying every single slice of this one to the fullest:)!!"
11044,2675,2001-06-25,0,"I used the sauce with my own pizza dough recipe.
It was thick and delicious.  I added 1 tsp. of sugar."
16459,12833,2001-10-19,5,"These were very good! Kind of like a chimichanga but not so big. They weren't too difficult to make either. I had to use the toothpicks, that frying part is a little tricky."
23413,13550,2001-11-12,0,"I was just wondering what kind of alcohol should be added to this recipe. It sounds great and I would
like to try if for some xmas party, any suggestions???"
9105,2066,2001-05-07,4,"A good quick recipe.
Great with additional ingredients also."
15609,12550,2001-10-12,5,"This is Good.  Especially if you like Stewed Tomatoes.  I always put bread on top of my stewed tomatoes, this is just a kind of a ""twist"" to stewed tomatoes."
6863,316,2001-04-18,2,Dolmades just cant be made without avgalimino sauce as it just doesn't have the same flavor.Check out a good recipe and try it you'll see what I mean.
7308,15220,2001-12-11,5,"It's a really great tasting and simple dressing, but it's not the Olive Garden Dressing I know (in Winnipeg).  I've been looking for this copycat recipe for a while, and am led to believe Olive Garden doesn't use mayo in their dressing.  I'm going to try Tonkats' version of this next."
4470,450,2001-12-07,5,I love Gado-Gado and this is a very good recipe.   I sometimes put the salad on a bed of Watrecress (when available)  Thanks Carol
23728,8929,2001-12-27,5,"Awsome,  I grilled the bread with a bit of olive oil and garlic first and served it like bruchetta.  Also added some fresh basil and parsley."
6512,8092,2001-03-16,5,"Very good recipe, especially for anyone on a low carbohydrate diet. This was pizza with out the crust. I added a step of draining the grease off after 20 min of cooking, and before putting back in the oven I added a layer of pepperoni on top, cooked another 5 min or until pepperoni's started to get crispy, and then added the cheese. Very easy preparation."
21304,13450,2001-10-30,4,This is also great for camping just stick in the warm ash and cook.
14983,10853,2001-08-31,4,Very Very easy.  We made 2 pies and froze one.  It tasted great on hot summer nights.
16459,10853,2001-10-03,3,really easy to make
6390,2980,2001-03-12,2,Did I miss where the wine and bread come in?
13461,6923,2001-08-02,3,Easy to make.not a lot of flavor.
6357,8947,2001-05-24,0,Its tooooo good to resist and once you start having it you can''t stop!!
6357,15160,2001-12-13,3,"It's nice, chilled is even better, but the onions were the cause of it not being extremely tasty. May I suggest you add few chopped olives instead of the onions. Otherwise, it was indeed a tongue tickler."
21656,9715,2001-11-19,4,"I made this recipe for dinner yesterday. It was
quite good and very easy to make, great for a busy weekend. The peaches and cinnamon are an 
interesting combo. I served mine with white rice."
22868,8653,2001-11-23,4,I really enjoyed this recipe.  I substituted walnuts for almonds and found it tasted great.  The only problem I found was that the cooking time wasn't right (maybe I did something wrong).  I found I had to cook them for almost 25 minutes before the toothpick came out clean.  Was delicious though!
24824,8653,2001-11-27,5,"Wonderful muffins, really moist, but be careful not to fill the cups to full it bakes right out of the pan!"
8575,8590,2001-06-07,5,i fixed these wings last night and they were great the only change i made was instead of coating them in the hot sauce mixture i dropped them in the pan i was simmering the mixture in and left them there while fryng the rest of the wings then put those in for a few min.
26502,8590,2001-12-17,5,"Just perfect, but for someone like my husband you may need to add more garlic powder, cayenne and  paprika,  better than anywhere else and for less, lots less."
10678,9267,2001-06-25,4,"this was very tasty but Very hot/spicy just incase be careful of that if you don't like hot things!!!
My family liked it a lot."
5327,9267,2001-08-08,4,"I loved this meal, but my husband and my two-year-old barely ate when I served it."
21694,13577,2001-11-03,5,This was fabulous.  This is a must try for everyone!
23060,13577,2001-11-08,5,"WOW!! This soup was amazing. It has a flavor unlike anything else I hjave ever tasted. Very exotic, sweet, but mild; great cold weather soup. This was so good I took it to work and shared it with a coworker, because I knew she would love it too.

I used canned chickpeas, and added cardamon and a pinch of five star powder. My taste buds just thought the flavor would be complemented with the additions."
14613,13577,2001-12-23,4,pretty good soup.  i put it on the stove and used canned chickpeas.
27188,13577,2001-12-26,1,It was Horrible!!  I had to throw the entire batch out..  My friend described it as a cross between Humus and Pumpkin Pie..   Ick!!
10548,2456,2001-06-05,0,"This cheesecake is great. Since my family is allergic to dairy I made it with goat cheese.I made it twice, once using all goat milk cream cheese and non dairy whipped topping,cheesecake was to heavy. I then made it using half cream cheese and half ricotta along with the non dairy whipped topping,cheesecake turned out light and    fluffy. Thank You for a great dessert.Nany"
13301,9015,2001-07-27,5,It was awesome!  The bacon bits gave it a great flavor!!!!!
16459,9015,2001-09-04,3,Very easy to make. I think I''ll leave out the bacon bits next time. Maybe I''ll try real bacon.
19043,9015,2001-10-01,5,This was great.  Thanks for the tip about saving some for later.  It made a lot of potatoes.  I have them in the freezer to bake at a later time.
13483,9015,2001-10-01,4,"I've never bought frozen hash browns before, but this worked very well.  It does make a lot so I, too, froze half of it.  The leftovers I had I wraped in a tortilla the next day for dinner.  I used cream of broccoli soup instead of mushroom.  It is a good recipe."
16766,9015,2001-10-23,5,I made this over the weekend the family and I loved it! Thanks
20371,9015,2001-11-08,4,Made this tonight and my guests really enjoyed it. The only frozen hashbrowns my grocery store had was 750g so I used 1-1/2 cups sour cream and cheese; kept the other ingredients the same though. It was very easy to put together and I will definitely make it again.
23267,9015,2001-11-21,5,"This recipe is simply wonderful.   I added cooked chopped chicken to make it a meal in one and me and my husband loved it.  It does make a very lot so freezing half the batch is a good idea.  This will become a regular in our house, easy to make and delicious to eat.  Thanks!!!"
23937,5177,2001-11-20,5,"What do YOU do with the extra 1/2 loaf of dough?

I have a large bunt pan, so I increased the ingredients by just a bit and used a full 2 loaves of frozen dough.  If you don't have the larger pan, you can always put the extra in a smaller pan and bake separately."
21694,11445,2001-11-20,5,"This was excellent.  The only difference is I used fresh tuna instead of canned, but I doubt that will make a big difference."
6179,6852,2001-03-03,0,"I would just like to say that this recipe comes from the cookbook, The Complete Soy Cookbook, by Paulette Mitchell."
6702,6852,2001-03-29,3,"I am new at trying tofu, but this one was quite nice. I would suggest finding some sort of marinade for the tofu before coating it though. Something light, that won't compete with the delicious ginger sauce. Even if you aren't a tofu fan, definately write down the ginger sauce recipe. YUM.

Next time, I may try freezing the tofu first too. That is supposed to give the tofu a ""meatier"" texture. Just drain, unwrap, rewrap in plastic very tightly, and freeze. I don't think you are supposed to thaw it completely before use though."
14613,6852,2001-10-29,4,"Ditto the ginger sauce rant.  The batter wasn't bad either; the wheat germ, surprisingly, was very flavorful."
10896,9993,2001-07-06,4,"This is excellant, really good with tuna or salmon steaks."
4470,9993,2001-08-06,4,I served this recipe with BBQ Fish fillets and everyone loved it! I used Angle Hair pasta.
13483,4682,2001-09-26,4,I am not a fish eater (love shell fish though). I did this for some people who wanted salmon grilled.  They were dutifully impressed and claimed it suited them just fine.  Based on their opinion I rated it 4 stars!
27257,11055,2001-12-27,5,Easy to make and very delicious!! I can really recommend this recipe for a cold day.  Served with vanilla ice cream it is a winner!!!!!!!!
5060,12042,2001-10-08,4,"Love the caraway, very good cabbage but we felt it needed salt and pepper, added it at the table.
Just happened to be snipping chives from the garden to freeze them, so I added a couple of tablespoons of them to the cabbage, I think it added to the taste. We enjoyed it and will use the recipe again.  Thanks Bergy!!"
19060,11753,2001-11-25,5,"Outstanding!  I was searching for a ""cozy"" soup and this was it.  Thanx for sharing such a great soup."
14386,13367,2001-12-04,5,This is one of my favorites! A great cake for chocolate lovers. Warm and delicious.
26271,13367,2001-12-15,1,This was definitely a horrid cake.  The water called for was too much and the taste was bland and unsatisfying.  Please do not try this one.
24784,8123,2001-11-27,5,this recipe was extemely easy to make. It only took me about 10 minutes to mix everything up and then i put it in the oven to cook. I made this cheescake for spanish food day at my school and everyone liked it! It was gone in just about 5 minutes..
26518,15869,2001-12-18,5,I'm so happy to have this recipe and thankyou for sharing it!
15135,8098,2001-08-15,4,I find that using sliced or cubed beff works much better that ground.  All and all this is a very good recipe.
22212,115,2001-10-28,5,"The white wine (I used an inexpensive local wine put out by Bully Hill Vineyards) and the flavor of the clams fused together and complemented the whole dish. This dish was very easy to make, and the whole family enjoyed it."
13483,11913,2001-09-28,5,This is good and beyond easy.  I swirled some chocolate sauce over the top for decoration and another taste dimention.  It was a little runny so next time I will put it in the freezer a half hour before serving.  Excellent simple and good recipe.  Thank you.
8897,8830,2001-06-05,0,"I cook a lot of fish, mostly salmon and lake trout, but this recipe has too much fat for me as I am low-fat cook and avoid sat fat as much as possible.  You often have recipes that I could use.  I do enjoy the weekly newsletter.Colleen"
21752,3208,2001-11-25,4,"I actually preferred this hot, it's perfect for a cold winter's night.  If you have a cold add some more ginger."
10404,10122,2001-09-10,5,I made this last night using veg stock (for my vegetarian daughter) and we all loved it.  I've never had cukes in soup like this.  Thanks for posting.  Di ;-)
6234,3812,2001-03-04,0,This is a great recipe! Try serving with hollandaise sauce.
25021,7229,2001-12-10,4,"My family likes this one real well. I added  mild 
cheddar cheese to the top of each pepper."
21694,12918,2001-10-20,5,Absolutly delicious.  I served it with some pasta.
9441,1442,2001-05-16,5,"YUMMM!  Growing up in a Dutch family in Mid-Michigan (yes, I also have family in Holland, MI), this recipe brings back memories of my childhood!  Thanks for reminding me how good they are!"
23302,15343,2001-12-10,5,"Excellent recipe. For personal taste, I crumbled Feta cheese into the dressing and, for a change of pace, served it over whole wheat pasta. I found the Italian seasoning to be a smidgen strong, so next time I will reduce it just a little."
4411,607,2001-01-08,5,"Aren't there 6 or seven stars to choose from.  WOW!  I was so excited to see this recipe.  I absolutely loved this soup when my husband and I would go to Famous Barr 30 years, when he was in the seminary at Concordia St. Louis.  I have made it through the years, because an aunt had sent me the recipe from her local Springfield, IL newspaper about 20 years.  Once I lost it, but a friend retrieved it for me from the time she had asked me for it.  What I love about your site is the instant way to double or triple or whatever the recipe!  I make this recipe a number of times each year, but I always make it for a big Christmas Party we have.  Everyone loves it and looks forward to it each year!  Thanks so much!  I always serve it with homemade bread and a Ceasar Salad.  I look forward to your newsletters."
13017,607,2001-07-23,5,"It is the most delicious onion soup I have even eaten, and when I lived in St. Louis I would eat it at least twice a week, especially on Friday."
18207,4753,2001-09-18,4,This recipe is very easy and very delicious. I found it to  be rich and filling. I made as a side with ribs.
19639,12083,2001-10-01,5,The title of this fondue is amusing.  A lovely fondue with surprising flavours.  The name of this fondue should be changed to The Great White North Fondue as its primary ingredient is Canadian sharp cheddar.  Remember to use a Canadian beer in the recipe as well.  Give yourself and your guests a treat.  Then again I may be wrong in assuming the name of the fondue is not appropriate.  A good disguise...cheers to the canucks!
10216,12083,2001-10-22,5,"I LLLOOOOOVEEE fondue! need garlic lots of garlic...can't have a fondue without garlic!!! (vampires beware!)... Well, now I think about it I dont want garlic in my chocolate fondue... I'll have to dig up the recipe and post it :)"
26684,16005,2001-12-20,0,"Delicious, especially warm from the oven.  Should be good with a pineapple smoothie,"
8221,8727,2001-04-13,4,"My friend  did this salad for me at a dinner she had.  It was so fabulous I had to ask her for 
recipe.  I made it again a few days later, and the family loved it.  I lost the recipe at home
and thanks to the net, I have it again! Definately a must do salad!  I served it at the end
of the meal.  It was like serving a 'salad' and 'dessert' in one dish! If you do do this recipe,
do add the shaved cheese. It's amazing!"
14257,9145,2001-08-10,5,"I've been looking for the perfect salsa recipe and feel like this is it.  Maybe it's the lime's (as Bonstr says) or the fresh Missouri Roma tomatoes....either way, this salsa is great.  Try it.

McCool

PS:  I add a little cilantro (just personal taste)!"
20832,9145,2001-10-09,5,"Oh.... my.. GAWD.... This is SALSA NIRVANA!!! I've never tasted anything like this in my life. I made it for a party, and people were practically tackling each other to get to it! I had to make another batch! Not super hot, but you could ""kick it up a notch"" with more jalapeno if you wanted, I suppose. VERY tart and citrus-laced. Lots of body, color, and visual appeal. Try it on burgers, chili, almost anything!!!

Bonstr, whoever you are, BOTTLE THIS STUFF!!! You'll be rich."
5981,9145,2001-11-12,5,"Holy cow!  This salsa is defintely ""Awesome"".  Never mind the chips...I could eat this with a spoon!  Yum"
15572,11886,2001-12-03,3,"I served it over angel hair pasta, and it was a little dry.  Next time, I think I will add a splach of red wine to make it more moist.  It was tasty though."
4470,12204,2001-10-01,5,"Thankyou Dorothy, I made this dish for brunch today and it looked great and tasted as good! I cut the recipe in half but left the Jalapeno & Garlic as called for. When I opened the fridge I saw ther were some bits and pieces of red, yellow and orange sweet peppers so added them as well. Excellent.  I'll be repeating this dish.  You can do ahead and just pop in the oven before brunch."
20629,12473,2001-10-31,0,good s#!t!
6357,15078,2001-12-04,5,"This is a real simple easy fudge. I''ve tried it before and its been a hit with all, especially the kids love it. Very simple and tasty!"
12892,7195,2001-07-19,4,"This is a great recipe!  You can also dredge the ""scotch eggs"" through egg and flour and then roll them in bread crumbs.  You can also fry them this way or bake them at around 450 for a healthier version."
26142,3572,2001-12-14,5,"Thanks, Great Recipe.  We all love it

12246,10729,2001-08-15,5,"I didn''t have pecans so I used walnuts. I used chocolate pudding and topped the cool whip with more walnuts. The recipe didn''t say what size container of cool whip, so I used the 12 oz size and the recipe was to die for."
27323,10729,2001-12-28,5,fantastic!! I''ve made it with the several different flavors of pudding.. they all taste great!
12875,10729,2001-12-29,5,I have this recipe only it is called 7 layer dessert.  I use 1 box of chocolate and one box of butterscotch pudding and they make 2 separate layers.  This is delicious.
4524,4561,2001-01-16,4,wasn't that bad ??????? why do the always make the chicken so big in the market place.
13483,11284,2001-09-04,5,I love simple and easy.  This was prepared in the early am and cooked in the pm.  Great stuff
22278,11284,2001-10-30,4,"Pretty and tasty.  I added broccoli for color and salsa so it wouldn't be dry and jalepenos for spice.  I also used soy cheese instead of dairy cheese.  Yummy,"
12657,11284,2001-11-21,5,"Loved this one too, Bergy! I was afraid it would be rather bland, but it turned out wonderfully. I'd also like to try this with broccoli instead of cauliflower, though the crisp baked cauliflower was very, very yum! I had this with freshly toasted bread for an absolutely delightful dinner :-)"
16140,12560,2001-10-28,4,"Very nice,real  comfort food,I did add some garlic though and served it with Jacket potatoes."
4242,992,2001-01-02,5,"my family loved these.  fresher than any boughten poppers.  take some preparation time, but are well worth it."
23293,12554,2001-11-10,5,"this recipe is mouth watering  loved every bite

    served it with white wine."
20832,9110,2001-10-09,5,"Oh, what a great idea! phyllo dough and ground beef! I tried it with the cinnamon and stuff, and it tasted very Greek, like a pasticcio. I made another one without those 2 sweet spices, and it was more Italian. You can make a huge variation in the taste just by varying the spice mix a little bit.

Yummy! I think I'm gonna gain weight, but oh well, food is love.

Please, post more recipes!!!"
20754,12859,2001-11-23,4,These cookies are great but I did add about 1/2 cup of extra flour to make the dough a little more managable.
10263,9220,2001-06-25,5,"Eve has cooked this one for me many times...its the best...so tasty, goes well with other meat dishes or even as a light dinner dish on its own...YUMMMMMM"
21618,12801,2001-10-20,1,Not Impressive
27503,11627,2001-12-31,5,I actually have this recipe in a cookbook of mine and it's delicious!!! I'm a novice in the kitchen and it was quite easy to make. I did however use a slightly larger pan so I made more of the first chocolate mix and it turned out great. A simple desert that will knock the socks off your guests.
18977,9063,2001-09-23,5,Exceptional flavor!
13483,902,2001-08-16,3,Very easy to make for a lunch.  I served it cold as a sandwich.  I found it a little too bland though.  Next time I make it I will add some cheese (like blue cheese or sharp cheddar)
10649,902,2001-12-05,2,"I agree with a little bit bland. I will try the cheese next time.
Keep Cooking Everyone!"
9672,15688,2001-12-25,4,"Great recipe, Thanks.

Easy to make and fun to eat. 

Made it for a Christmas office party and had many requests for the recipe.

The name is fun too"
20371,15688,2001-12-25,5,"This was a big hit at our family get-together on xmas eve, with both kids and adults. I had 2 people ask for the recipe! It was easy to make, and tasty too; all I would suggest is making sure you use 2 cookie sheets to spread the mixture out on. I used one and it was a bit of a pain breaking the mixture up after it had hardened since it was pretty thick."
21641,13064,2001-11-12,4,"Easy to fix, and really good. My daughters kindergarden class loved it."
6357,15426,2001-12-20,5,"EXCELLENT! I added 2 cups milk, 9 tsp butter and 10 tsp. sugar to this and it is delicious!!!"
8631,2267,2001-07-19,4,"Pretty tasty.  Although, I found it on the sweet side.  I would suggest reducing the icing sugar to a 1 1/2 cups or even a cup depending on the sweetness you prefer."
25777,14337,2001-12-10,5,"These were the most popular appetizer at Thanksgiving!  We were having some vegetarians at our Thanksgiving feast, so I made an extra batch of the cranberry sauce and put in the vegetarian (soy) meatballs from Trader Joe's, and that way everyone was happy!"
2312,14337,2001-12-26,5,"YUM. These were a big hit for our Christmas gathering (so festive!).  Used fresh cranberry sauce, and less catsup than was called for (because I didn't have enough) but it worked out fine.  Only thing was I didn't realize it called for a crockpot, so I just put it in the oven on low for 20 minutes (until we couldn't wait any longer).  They would definately benefit from a slow sit in the sauce though.  Thank goodness I got a crockpot for Christmas!!!!"
24122,14337,2001-12-28,5,"We really enjoyed this recipe.  the sauce has a sweeter taste different than a tomato based recipe, but that was what I was looking for.  Excellent flavor and easy to make.  I made the meatballs and cooked them the day before.  Then, when they cooled, I put them in a baggie in the fridge until the next day.  They were wonderful and the leftovers reheated  well in the microwave.  In fact, they just keep getting tastier!"
27452,14337,2001-12-31,5,My family really enjoyed these meatballs.  I did make a mistake because I cut the recipe in half thinking that I would have made too many.  Silly me next time I won't make the same mistake..
11449,6561,2001-06-19,5,"AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH, son!  Man, is dem sum gud mudbugs!!!    MMMMMMM  cant wait to git me sum mo!"
25690,10117,2001-12-25,5,"EVERYONE LOVES THESE COOKIES!  I recommend using butter instead of margarine for better tasting cookies, and my oven took 12 minutes to make them golden and perfect. I couldn't believe how fast these cookies were eaten!!  They are great!!"
21752,11336,2001-11-05,4,This is a good recipe if you have a bored 10 year old in the house.  My daughter invited several thousand of her closest friends over (at least that was the noise level) and they could handle this recipe all by themselves.  Even the dog joined in (cleaning up dropped dough).
13483,617,2001-09-20,4,Did this for a desert and coffee night.  Made them a week ahead and put them in the freezer.  Tasted as though they just came out of the freezer.  Will do these again.  Thanks
26313,14928,2001-12-16,5,"very, very good! :)"
12782,693,2001-08-30,4,This recipe is good for a quick meal.  Be careful not to add more milk than it calls for!
13483,693,2001-09-23,4,"What a simple ""souper"" (no pun indended) dish.  I served this over rice with beans and cream corn on the side. Not an eligant dish but what a winner as an every day fast and easy dish.  It has may way to vary it.  I'll do it often"
16854,11277,2001-09-20,0,"When I fry corn, I use silver queen, also I use milk and butter instead of a can of cream corn and it takes longer than 10 minutes to cook"
19043,11277,2001-10-01,5,"This was really very good.  I liked the creamed corn.  I added some red peppers as well, it was a pretty dish."
15609,11277,2001-10-01,5,"This is very good.  Mom always used cream instead of the creamed corn.  I use the cream corn.  I think you get more of a ""Corn"" flavor.  This is kinda related to my corn casserole.  A distant cousin maybe but related."
12021,3632,2001-07-02,4,the family loves it.
23746,14130,2001-11-15,4,"I LOVED this recipe, and the only reason I took away one star was the fact that it was a bit bland in the taste. A great, healthy means of eating for breakfast and I love eating this before a big sports event or game, since I don't like the fat content in foods. To give it a bit more flavor, I suggest adding Cinnamin to the batter, it adds a lot of flavor."
6357,14130,2001-12-10,5,"WOW! These are addictive! I used 1/4 ltr. of Fresh milk instead of skim milk and 2 large ripe bananas instead of 2 small ripe ones. I mashed the bananas first and then added that to the sugar-flour mixture. It took me nearly 30 minutes to make these, but it was well worth the effort, because 1000% these are ""yum""!! We enjoyed it with evening tea. Great recipe you got here:)!!"
12657,14130,2001-12-28,0,Substituting whole-wheat flour with cornmeal is a wonderful variation to the recipe! Had them for breakfast yesterday... yum :)
27454,16337,2001-12-31,4,Watch out ..Ben is not that gentle :)
13797,1420,2001-08-05,5,"I've been making a variation of this recipe for 20 years and most prople say it is better than ""Grandma usta make."" Secret to fluffy buscuits is not to underwork the dough."

23132,2498,2001-11-15,5,this is VERY easy and oh so YUMMY!!!!! a family favorite!!!!!
26366,2498,2001-12-16,5,"An outstanding easy, delicious recipe that everyone loves!!!  I have taken this to several parties and it is loved by everyone.  It is a must that you bake it in a 9 x 13 pan and serve with whip cream"
17608,14103,2001-11-23,0,"Another adaptationthat I learned from my MIL is this:  Instead of cinnamon schnapps, use peppermint.  Add 1 scoop of vanilla ice cream to each mug.  Now, you have a Hot Alpine!"
23607,13744,2001-11-14,5,"I've used this recipe for several years, it is a favorite of my guests and a great alternative to the too sweet standard sweet potato casseroles.  I"
2312,13744,2001-12-08,4,"This tasted great, but it didn't ""look"" as I expected it to.  I guess I would have liked a bit more liquid or something to help everything ""mush"" together.  Perhaps I just cooked it too long...  Still it was a great Thanksgiving sweet potato dish."
26999,12309,2001-12-25,5,"This is an awesome recipe!!!  I would prefer these turtles over Fannie May, any day!  It is a bit time consuming, but the results are fantastic."
21107,12747,2001-10-22,0,"I made this cake to take to a buffet supper. Everyone loved it and I got many compliments. It 
cuts beautifully and the lemon gives it a light taste and the poppy seeds add texture."
17293,9753,2001-08-31,5,"Delicious, but one must make sure to cook all the different ingriedients slowly to allow the tastes to explode in your final dish."
6357,12716,2001-11-16,5,"Excellent, we make this at home but use cilantro instead of parsley and water instead of vegetable stock. I love brown rice alot and mom insists on carrots, so it's a great combination!"
26979,14999,2001-12-23,5,"Yes, this is a very easy recipe, but it's also very tasty.  

The squares of fudge were beautiful in little foil cups on my Christmas treat platters. The contrast of the white fudge with chunks of red and green were so ""Christmas-y"". -- a definite crowd pleaser."
21487,9713,2001-11-27,5,"Ditto on the tabasco, I too like my dishes hot & spicy. This is so easy and so tasty...THANK YOU!"
12129,9713,2001-07-27,5,This was fabulous!  I would add some tabasco sauce though because it wasn't quite spicy enough for my tastes.  The cream cheese really mellows out the spice.  Very yummy!  The kids in my house were licking the bowl.
19810,9713,2001-09-25,5,"Oh yea, this is yummy!"
19091,9713,2001-10-09,5,This is awesome! I just microwaved it. It was so easy. Love it!
14433,9713,2001-10-20,5,"So easy. Along with the great taste, makes this recipe a Super Star."
22475,9713,2001-11-01,5,"Excellent!  This one was quite a hit for our ""dip as you can"" dinner on Halloween night while we served candy to the goblins at the front door.

My one comment on this area of recipezaar in general...WHERE ARE THE LOW CARB FOODS?  None of these are low carb so far, though if you left off the chips on this one, it might come close.  However, it'd be too rich to handle."
18977,7219,2001-10-15,5,"Sounds great!  But...do you use fresh, raw or cooked asparagus or do you use canned?
Is there no liquid required in the veggie soup mixture?"
11291,3628,2001-06-26,5,"Extremely tasty recipe. I did rabbit before and was very unsatisfied thinking that rabbitmeat is just not tender. But no, not when it has been soaked in tasty redwine overnight. Try it! You'll love it!"
21471,3628,2001-10-17,5,This was the first time i have had rabbit and it was amazing.  The prunes were a nice touch and the recipe was fairly easy.  Rabbits Rule!
8511,4978,2001-04-19,2,This dish might have tasted better by either replacing the tuna with a white fish or by adding olives or something. It was also a bit to bold tasting for me.
4445,4978,2001-04-26,4,This recipe is good with either white fish or tuna.  My sicillian husband found it a little bland so I substituted roasted red peppers for bell peppers.
14422,4978,2001-08-21,3,"Doubled quatity of elbo macaroni to mre casseole-like.  With the tuna, it's a challenge to keep it moist."
4470,10011,2001-07-31,5,"Excellent,  slightly different salad. I used 1/4 cup of sweet onion instead of the spring onion.  It went well with cold chicken. Thanks"
14613,10011,2001-10-10,2,not all that impressed with this one.  the parsley didn't compliment the combo of flavors at all.  i only ate a bit before throwing the rest out.
8728,2774,2001-07-19,2,The bread is tasteless.
10260,2774,2001-07-24,0,"Haven't tried this yet, but wanted to comment to Ashley that Navajo Fry Bread is meant to be topped with powdered sugar or honey, or used for the delectable ""Navajo Taco"" (top with refried beans, lettuce, tomato and shredded cheese)."
26692,14200,2001-12-31,4,"This was an easy recipe to make and was very tasty.  You may need to tweek the seasonings to your taste, though."
13504,11067,2001-08-29,4,Very Good!  This is an easy recipe and perfect as a colorful Holiday gift.  Thanks so much for the recipe!
17608,12808,2001-11-05,5,"This is really a great cake!  Sometimes you need a break from the norm, this will do just fine.  Quick, easy, very tasty."
13063,15228,2001-12-23,0,"I just made these again this morning, adding in two chopped-up apples.  Yum!  They had to bake a wee bit longer, but were so moist and incredibly good!"
26066,15059,2001-12-13,5,"This is an excellent cookie recipe.  Great for gift giving also.  I have made this for a couple of
years...only difference is that I don't sprinkle peanuts on the cookies just in case
of food allergies that someone may have."
19895,2387,2001-09-26,5,Yum cool tastes just right
9869,2387,2001-10-25,5,"First time I have ever tried this pie, have always loved Lemon Meringue pie...so figured Id give this a go. GREAT decision!"
25757,10045,2001-12-10,4,"Excellent flavor (just sweet enough to let you know its there). Once cooled filling spreads evenly, Very easy to make, a PERFECT filling for your layer cake it was a tremendous hit!!!! Many thanks to you for posting. 
THANKS,
      Steve"
12200,10159,2001-07-13,0,This cake is the moistest cake I have ever tryed.  What a wonderful way to eat zucchini.
12307,3597,2001-07-09,5,"Excellent cake! But pay attention to the ingredient list. My husband read the ingredient as pudding and we baked it first time out with pudding. The cake flopped. Second time, we baked with a yellow cake mix with pudding included, and the cake turned out fabulous!!"
15609,12115,2001-10-02,5,"Very Good.  I used fresh tomatoes though since I have so many.  And fresh basil.  Other than that, I followed this recipe."
25366,12115,2001-12-04,5,My 11 year old made this as a math project.  He used all ingredients and exact measurements.  It is wonderful.  Easy to make.  Worth the extra time.
21694,502,2001-10-28,5,"Absolutly wonderful, a must try."
21694,13572,2001-11-03,5,"This was absolutly wonderful, but I used fresh beans instead of frozen."
15385,10752,2001-11-25,5,"very good and tasty......a simple dish that gives satisfaction
thank you"
6357,9701,2001-09-06,0,"A favourite with those from Mumbai, India including me!"
9121,15348,2001-12-10,5,These hit the spot.  I added cashew pieces to a few of these and they turned out nicely as well.
23836,15348,2001-12-16,4,a real flavor delight  but a bit involved ... would be a good one to make with my nephews.
1634,12484,2001-10-08,0,"I like to wait to add the cheese until after the eggs have been poured into the hot pan, and have begun to set. This offers the eater a flavor burst with every bite and when making omlelettes for several people, the amount of cheese can be adjusted to individual taste."
22099,12021,2001-10-28,5,Yummy! Very easy to make and no cracks in the cheesecake. I used cinnamon graham crackers instead of the cookies. I''m going to make this for Thanksgiving.
25267,9471,2001-12-04,4,Great tasting. I replaced the sauce with a spicey chille sauce.
6755,7224,2001-04-22,4,This is a tasty use for eggplant that's easy to prepare and healthy to eat.
6512,7224,2001-11-08,4,Excellent side dish. Very tasty. I only had a small eggplant so I added mushrooms to stretch. Instead of fresh tomatoes I used a can of Italian tomatoes.
5704,3436,2001-02-12,4,"Variation, instead of vinegar use freshly squeezed lemon juice."
21267,3436,2001-12-05,5,"Very Good! This was my first try at it, and it came out great! It wasn't hard at all. Being raised in a half filipino family - it tastes very much like my mom's recipe! Next time, I'll cook it for my mom too and see what she thinks of it. =)

Note: Adobo is better with a sweet flavor, so I added brown sugar to mine as a variation and it worked out very well!"
12655,673,2001-08-24,4,"This is a great, easy recipe.  I used malted vinegar and it was very tasty.  I will double the recipe next time as it only made about 3 servings.  It was fast, easy and a great salad for a warm day.  i am interested in trying a few options..like maybe coriander instead of white pepper and maybe a little yogurt instead of all sour cream.  I suggest you make it by the recipe first.  I loved it."
5633,4627,2001-02-04,5,"My favorite Tortilla Soup is from the Red Robin in Del Mar, Calif.  This is almost identical.  Very easy.  I would start with 8 tortillas and go up from there - 10 was a little thicker then I like. You can always add more."
8983,4627,2001-05-03,5,This soup was very good my whole family loved it I will be making that again.
9178,4627,2001-05-10,0,"This IS quite delicious and not difficult to make.  Thanks to Bonnie Thompson for the measurements (vs. ounces).  The best tortilla soup I've ever had was at Pancho's in Cabo San Lucas.  I copied their style by adding a dollop of sour cream (non-fat is OK)and a couple of slices of avocado to the top of this soup, and garnished with chopped fresh cilantro.  Ummm, good!!"
14257,4627,2001-08-10,5,"I absolutely loved this soup.  I did reduce the Taco seasoning to 3 1-ounce packets to keep it slighty less spicy, but it was just excellent.  You won't be sorry if you try it.

McCool :-)"
20114,4627,2001-10-23,5,I made a double batch because it said 4 servings but I now have enough soup to feed a small army - I will freeze some for later. I only used 3 1.25 oz. pkgs of taco seasoning and it was perfect. I also used a 12 oz. can of evaporated skim milk to cut some calories. My husband likes thick soup so I used 2 10 count pkgs of tortillas (remember I made a double batch). Thanks for the recipe - we love it!
14077,7353,2001-10-07,5,I have two hungry teenage boys and they absolutly love this dish. We have made it one of our special weekend dinners. Mashed taters and green beans with rolls makes this a very filling meal.
16459,14507,2001-12-25,5,"I made this recipe for my birthday. I've never made risotto before and must admit to being intimidated by it. This recipe was easy to follow and the taste was excellent. I didn't have any regular champagne on hand, so I used a red spumanti. It worked fine"
15572,10393,2001-09-10,4,Super sauce.  Try the sauce on fish.
4470,12249,2001-12-17,5,"Tebo, you've done it again!  A beautiful simple to do, tasty, recipe.  I didn't marinate them for 15 min I just put the skin side down in the baking dish I was going to use, poured the sauce over and left them in the fridge until cooking time, turned them over and baked them , middle rake for about 45 min.  They were brown, crisp and good.  I also added some pepper  Thanks Tebo"
9121,10807,2001-08-23,5,I used more garlic than it called for and veg parmesan cheese.  Really good.
2312,13521,2001-11-10,3,"this was okay, just seemed to be lacking in flavor. Used leftover salmon from roasted salmon the night before and it just tasted a bit blah.  perhaps I have too high of an expectation for salmon patties, but I think it could be jazzed up with something else...teriyaki?"
17503,13521,2001-11-17,2,"Salmon patty recipies are hard to find. I agree with Gilmore that this one is a little bland. I will start experimenting with added ingrediets starting with mayonase & some parsley in the mix.
Rob"
20076,13521,2001-11-26,0,This recipe sounds rather blah so I will submit my recipe for salmon patties in a day or so as they do have more taste then these would seem to have.
5748,5184,2001-03-03,4,"This was really good, however, I left out the turnips due to a family memebers dislike, but added 2 tblsp of worshirer sauce. YUM!!!"
10896,648,2001-07-05,4,"This is excellant, I'm always looking for fresh salads in the summer months. Yum!"
15624,648,2001-08-21,0,1 Weight Watcher point per serving!! WOW
10678,9155,2001-06-11,5,"Excellent easy recipe - I made w/out coconut and it was still good. Also, substituted oat flour for the oat meal and it worked just fine."
6233,517,2001-03-04,5,"Exceptional!

Could not find any decent ground lamb today, so we made it with 1/2 lb each of lean ground beef, pork and veal - different taste from lamb, but truely outstanding.

GREAT Dinner Party meal"
5285,517,2001-05-30,4,"Oh, this was yummy. I screwed up the recipe like mad - parsley in the stuffing rather than in the meat, and forgot to buy oats so I used bread crumbs & ground walnuts instead. I smothered a slice in skordalia, took a bite and kinda jumped in my seat. I'm not giving it five stars because that would seem a little absurd, but it sure is yummy."
21758,12951,2001-10-22,5,I use this oil always
25656,12951,2001-12-08,5,"you can use this oil in foccacia bread and add alittle fresh basil too. it is superb on salad, or drizzled onto fresh bread."
10997,8533,2001-07-05,0,"The ""Black"" in ""Shirley Temple Black"" is actually her married name.  She married Charles Black in 1950 and added ""Black"" to her original name."
4277,5283,2001-01-02,0,"I just found this recipe, but I am going to bake it, would be great with a salad...."
2070,5283,2001-01-18,5,This bread is absolutely delicious and so easy.It's a new family favorite. We even enjoyed it for breakfast. Thanks
14386,5283,2001-08-23,1,"The ingrediants sound good,but where are the directions?I have no idea how to even begin to make this!"
12962,8576,2001-09-19,5,Absolutely supremo!!!!!!  I used beef boullion granuals with hot water in the base.  The veggies reduce size during cooking.
19799,11156,2001-10-28,5,This also has been a requested dish at all my family's holiday dinners too.I add lots of real bacon bits and a liberal shake of Mrs.Dash spice mix to the Miracle Whip and leave out the salt.There never is any leftovers.
12660,2994,2001-07-16,5,"The preparation was fairly easy and the instructions were step by step. However, the recipe calls for 3 tablespoons of ice water in the making of the crust, which I found made the crust watery. The overall tart was delicious! I served it at a dinner party and the entire thing was finished within fifteen minutes. I was even told that it had ""restaurant quality""!"
19185,13442,2001-11-08,0,"This was a flop for me. There was no way it would've formed balls -- the dough was very wet. I dropped it by teaspoons and got about twice as many as the recipe said it would make. They spread out quite a bit on the cookie sheet, and burned to a crisp in about two minutes less time than the recipe said to bake them.

It seems like maybe there wasn't enough flour (like, about twice as much might have done it).

Think I'll try it again with double the amount of flour, and submit a correction. Meanwhile, I'm hoping someone else has tried it and can give me some suggestions.
Frances"
5964,6511,2001-02-20,4,"We cut up some chorizo (instead of andouille) and put it into the sauce, and used it on chicken. It was great, but with a salty sausage like chorizo, using the recommended amount of salt in the recipe was a little too much. I would definitely reccomend this for anyone who loves barbeque!"
10678,8930,2001-06-11,5,excellent - took to a potluck and everyone loved it (mostly carnivores there) and didn't realize it was vegan!
15572,14371,2001-12-15,3,"Even though I like spicy, and this is a little bland, still it tastes good and is a good very quick light meal.  But next time, I believe I will chuck in some ground chili and perhaps a touch of chili powder."
6338,4332,2001-08-23,4,"This turned out surprisingly well, considering it looks quite a mess going into the oven! The fudge sauce at the bottom of the cake was smooth and delicious."
7104,5188,2001-08-29,4,"Very tasty, however, if you like spicy/hot, you will need to add more red pepper flakes."
18043,4024,2001-11-27,5,"The sauce is great! And so easy to prepare :-) We tried adding a bit more oil (olive oil) and a squeeze of lime. Don't think it was really necessary, but it prevented the salmon getting too dry.

As for the cooking itself, we tried this on an electric oven at around 200C for about 40 min and it was simplicity itself.

Many thanks for the recipe!"
10505,5015,2001-11-27,5,This is really good.The only thing i did not like was the water chestnuts.I will make this again but i wiil not use the water chestnuts.
24528,15577,2001-12-23,4,I love this recipe!  It's wonderful - disappeared so quick that I'll have to make more of these goodies for the holidays.
9121,11287,2001-09-07,5,This is deeelish!!
18133,11287,2001-09-18,5,Hey!!!!Very very good now Pam & I won''t have to try to figure out what to make for you We will just look at your recipes...:)looks good can''t wait till you make it for us!!!!!
5495,4550,2001-02-01,4,great when sprinkled with grated parmasaen cheese just before serving!
20076,11433,2001-10-11,4,"These ""Easy Potatoes"" were just that - easy and quick.  My family enjoyed them.  I sprinkled paprika over them before baking.  I might also try them again with shredded cheddar cheese and/or hot chillies or a little cut up jalapeno for a change."

thanks,

5280,3811,2001-01-22,4,This casserole was very tasty but a little time consuming to prepare. Next time I know we are going to have this dish (and we definitally will be having it again) I will do the prep work ahead of time.
25267,11735,2001-12-04,5,So close to the original that you can have KFC in your own home. I also use this on chicken pieces.
25999,11735,2001-12-12,5,This recipe is what made me become a member of recipezaar. Once I made it I enjoyed it so much I had to comment on it. I added some extra herbs and spices like thyme. This added to it.
21275,15043,2001-12-25,5,"This pie is delicious! Since my family dislikes nuts, I substituted Heath toffee bits for the pecans. It tastes like the pie version of Better Than Sex cake...this recipe is an absolute must for chocolate lovers!"
5644,8563,2001-05-07,5,Wonderful recipe !   My paprikash never turned out better since I started using this nockerl recipe.
12657,6598,2001-10-22,4,"Turned out wonderful! Probably needs just a little more sugar though, maybe 1 tablespoon more (for the original recipe). I'd add some more cinnamon for a stronger flavour too. Tastes amazing with apple jam :-)"
5662,3611,2001-02-12,5,"The BEST anchovie based dressing I have found to date, bar none."
14971,3611,2001-08-15,5,It's wonderful!!.  We have been making this receipt of Mayfair dressing for more than 20 years. My parents visited your restaurant and were given the ingredients  many years ago.  It's about the only dressing used in our house!  thanks again.!!

20076,11567,2001-12-29,5,"My husband (a borderline diabetic) thoroughly enjoyed this.  He missed having a regular fix of cheesecake that he loves so well.

I didn''t have splenda but used a regular artificial sweetner.  I also didn''t have Vermont sugar-free syrup but used a regular sugar-free syrup and noticed is was made with splenda.

I will definitely make this again for him."
26631,15953,2001-12-19,4,really good & easy
13483,11417,2001-10-20,5,Excellent do ahead dish.  I thought the broccoli may be a bit mushy after an hour in the oven but it comes out crisp and good.  Loved it.  Thanks again Bergy.
27482,8848,2001-12-31,4,I started with this recipe and added andouille sausage and chicken breast. This was great. Becareful with the andouille - it can be really hot!
5060,13320,2001-12-18,5,"They were, as you say Bergy, a bit time consumming,but agian as you said, worth it!!
I did freeze them, undone, and took about 2 dozen out to try out with friends, we all loved them, they were delicious, we did the dipping a little different, we used sour cream/chives and ground ginger,(was what we had around) it worked fine, but added some calouries of course.  Thanks Bergy another great one!!"
6357,3116,2001-06-01,5,That recipe is really inviting!
13155,3116,2001-09-20,3,"I liked the recipe but it was rather bland. I expected more flavor with all the spices that were used. It was easy to make, the rice was very good, I would probably use four red chillies the next time.I was unsure as to how much cilantro to add and when to add it."
21163,3010,2001-10-15,5,This is wonderful!  You can also use Special K or Corn Flakes.
22001,13909,2001-11-26,5,Easy to make and very tasty
10257,3351,2001-05-29,5,"The Stewed Rhubarb was excellent.  I followed the recipe and added the strawberries, it was so easy to made.  My husband really enjoyed it.  Thanks"
4470,3351,2001-07-02,4,This is a very tasty way of cooking rhubarb. I sliced fresh strawberries and added them just be fore serving and used vanilla yogurt. I love your recipes Dancer
20371,15047,2001-12-21,5,"Chocolate-orange has to be the best flavour combination there is! These cookies had my entire family going, ""Yum!"" and even the poor dog tried to get in on the munching. My only changes were to use real butter instead of margarine, and chill the dough before baking. A permanent addition to my recipe collection; thanks Mirjam!"
27469,15242,2001-12-31,4,"excellent, use shredded hashbrown and thaw them first!"
15368,4078,2001-09-07,5,"Great for Sunday Brunch!!  Make extra syrup, that was soooo good!"
10896,8634,2001-06-12,4,This is very good. I added some parmesan and tabasco to taste.
4470,11140,2001-11-29,4,"Very good tasting recipe.  I used lite olive oil and left out the cornstarch.  This was served with  crockpot chicken and the taste contrast was great Thanks,   Bergy"
6600,8634,2001-03-19,5,what a great recipe. I can use it as a main dish or as a side dish with breaded cutlets.
5899,2923,2001-02-18,0,This is a great recipe that's too easy.
21178,2923,2001-11-12,5,This is a great recipe.  It makes even the least experienced cook a great one.
16140,585,2001-09-24,4,Lovely as a breakfast dish.I also used olive oil and added some freshly chopped parsley to the mix for some colour.
4262,585,2001-01-02,4,"This was an easy recipe to make.
I used olive oil instead of drippings Health reason only)
The seasonings were quarter teaspoon cummin,pinch dried thyme.
 It has an acceptable taste"
8526,8781,2001-04-24,5,Wonderful tasting and beautiful looking salad. Perfect for company. I added 1 thinly sliced apple. Good with fish and white wine.
6362,3222,2001-03-12,5,This recipe is outsatanding it took me by surprise on how deleicous it was thanks recipezaar
4470,9120,2001-07-02,3,"This a very tasty recipe however, when I cut the recipe in half I could not get the cakes to hang together.  The result was a bit messy.  I'll try it again and do the full recipe."
15572,9120,2001-08-29,4,I only used one and a half packages of crackers.  Try topping with sour cream and chives.
14613,9120,2001-08-30,2,"Yeah, the 'cakes' kept falling apart, so i added more cracker to the mix, which helped the elements gel better.  But ultimately it tasted like wet crackers with tomato juice. (Not that great.)"
20754,14187,2001-11-23,5,This bread is awesome!  It really does melt in your mouth.  This is a keeper!
7401,8121,2001-03-29,5,"Very unique, but definately one I'd make again. This is a much more flavorful version of the standard cheesecake. Great for all dessert-lovers!"
21734,27560,2001-11-12,4,"Good stuff. Made this and served with a 'wedge' of iceberg lettuce and some crumbled mozzerella.

Didn't have the onion powder, onion salt or that much parsley (!!), but it tasted fine. I added 1/8 cup salt to make up for the missing onion salt. I think it came out a little on the salty side, so prob. won't add anything next time."
6512,5447,2001-10-23,4,"I used bone in chicken leg quarters. I just browned in a little oil until chicken is almost done. Then removed chicken from pan and sauteed onions,mushrooms and peppers. Added rest of ingredients, simmered them for 10 minutes then added chicken and simmered another 10 mintues. 
Very Tasty."
9869,12832,2001-10-31,5,"Made this with chicken, cant buy tins of green chillis here so I used fresh.
Loved the flavours, and so did my picky teenager.
Thanks for sharing. =)"
2595,13116,2001-10-28,4,This is really delicious. I love the combination of flavors
18660,12587,2001-11-01,5,"The recipe produces an authentic South of the Border Carne Guisada.  This is one of my favorite Mexican dishes.  I added 2 cubed potatoes and added them as I browned the meat, cooked it about ten minutes and added the rest of the ingredients and simmered for 20 minutes. Instead of using plain tomatoes, I added two cans of diced tomatoes (10 ounces)with green chiles. Now I guess I'll have to make homemade flour tortillas to go with this."
15385,13862,2001-11-08,5,"I very liked that recipe, but I cooked it on the stove instead of the microwave......."
6357,15292,2001-12-20,5,"This tea is ""DELICIOUS""! I just decided that I had to try this this evening, and, made 1 cup of this tea. OOOOOOOOOH!!!! I am going crazy and oooh and aaaah o'er this tea, it's so different from the usual tea. I'm not a great tea lover, I love coffee, especially cappucino, but, this tea is now on the top of my list of favourite beverages. I've added 2 tsps. of white sugar and I used about 1 1/2 tbsp. of brown sugar for 1 cup of tea. I just have to say that I'm addicted to this tea from this day. Thank you for such a gingery-spicy-sweet delcious evening with this ""Out of the world"" tea:)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
25222,15292,2001-12-26,2,Sorry - I thought it was disgusting.
23957,15487,2001-12-29,4,"My grandfather come from Denmark, and we had these every Christmas at their house.  The recipe my grandmother used included chopped apples in the batter.  She also added raisins to some.  They were always rolled in powdered sugar or confectionary sugar when they were still hot out of the pan.  Best if eaten warm.  They don't hold longer than a day.  Brings back old memories."
21694,11919,2001-10-30,5,One of the best stews I have ever eaten (and I have eaten a lot of stews)!
10175,11157,2001-09-04,5,I made these and they were fantastic.
14613,7645,2001-12-03,4,a good way to put a little extra kick into a broccoli side dish.  i added some cherry tomatoes to the mix.
13483,11914,2001-09-28,5,"I made this a ""do ahead"" by boiling the onions in the morning and baking just before dinner.  I also added and extra tbs or two of chile sauce after it had baked.  This ""kicked it up a notch.""
Thanks again Bergy."
12875,12073,2001-12-29,0,this salsa is GREAT..my family LOVED it!!!
6164,15337,2001-12-07,0,"Try heating one tablespoon of pure ghee or butter. Add a pinch of asfoetida, mustard seeds and few curry leaves to it and when they begin to splutter add the same to your rajma curry before eating..it will enrich the taste further.

14766,10710,2001-08-15,4,"This recipe is great.  Good, balanced dry rub.  If you don't like the Habenero heat, use dried chipotle instead...that gives quite a nice smokey flavor as well..."
22405,12419,2001-10-29,5,very easy to prepare and tates wonderful!
10216,12974,2001-10-23,5,"Oh! yum yum yum... It looks like we share taste in more than just Feta cheese. The toasted bread is a perfect touch... but croutons are fun if you're serving this at a dinner party (nice starter dont you think?).
I'll see if I can post a baked alaska recipe for you that you dont already have :)))"
19043,4928,2001-10-12,4,My husband is Norweigan and I have been looking for Norweigan recipes.  This really is very good.  He likes it cold with milk on top.  Thanks.
24437,3313,2001-11-22,5,"This is a wonderful and very easy to make fudge.
It does sound odd with the cheese but it is fabulous."
5349,630,2001-04-03,5,"This soup was delicious.  I did not add a blanched tomato but rather reduced the broth by 1 cup and added 10 ounces of canned diced tomatoes.
The parmasen cheese adds a great flavour. Oh so good!!!!!!!!"
15609,11894,2001-09-21,5,"I made this except I used frozen chopped spinach instead of the fresh.  They were FANTASTIC. (I used the frozen because I had everything on hand EXCEPT fresh spinach, I had frozen.) Seemed to work well though. just make sure to thaw and drain WELL!"
1634,11677,2001-09-17,3,"This idea would be very nice for camping trips, for young people who might want to try a tin foil reflector oven in front of a fire or maybe even in a dutch oven. For adults... coating the ham in honey/mustard sauce ( 1 tbs mustard, 1 tbs honey and 1/2 teaspoon vinegar )first would add a little punch."
21752,12957,2001-11-26,5,"This is an excellent version of one of my favorite local desserts.  I made this with orange juice instead of lemon, and it was delicious!  This is not a cake typical to American palates, but I highly suggest everyone try this at least once!"
3337,7427,2001-01-05,4,"It takes approximately 45 minutes to prepare meatballs & sauce. Serving size is approximately 38 meat balls. I used ground turkey instead of beef & came out much better, used fresh garlic & minced together with the onions, also a dash of cajun & Itatilian seasonings made the meatballs a complete success."
22015,12360,2001-11-28,5,"We loved the creamy texture of this dish.  I didn't know that homemade mac & cheese was so easy.  I added ham & broccoli to make it a main dish casserole and my husband, who doesn't care for mac & cheese said that it was a keeper.  Thanks for the suggestion, Lennie."
8367,54484,2001-07-09,1,"I tries this recipe and it was awful.  I didn't like the tast at all, even my husband(who is a beer drinker) didn't like it."
12491,8745,2001-08-07,5,"Very Very Good! Cheese is a wonderful thing! :)
Thank you for sharing this recipe!"
9869,8709,2001-09-16,5,"Really yum Kat..Ive even made these pita 'pizzas' with a small tin of baked beans if Ive had no sauce, also used a red onion.  =)"
1634,8709,2001-09-23,5,"Great idea for a student with limited kitchen access, and with only a few more calories than a candy bar, it makes a nice pick me up between meals. I use the tortilla  in a microwave for 2 minutes on high, and then roll it up."
7308,8709,2001-10-01,0,"If you're just making one or two (or if you don't have an oven), these are simple to do in a toaster oven."
9441,8709,2001-10-03,4,"I tried this recipe using a tortilla.  The first few bites were really good, but then the center of the tortilla started to get really soggy from the tomato sauce.  My kids gobbled it up, though!  I will try it agin using a pita instead.  Thanks for posting this recipe!"
21144,276,2001-10-23,4,This was a great recipe. I cut the rolls up into pieces and served them as an appetizer.
21434,276,2001-12-28,4,Good recipe. The next time I make this dish I'll use a strong cheese [maybe Goat Cheese]. The feta cheese was not distinctive. I'll also add some salt to it.
21694,10216,2001-10-30,5,Very good.  I'll definitly have to make it again at Christmas.
10649,17365,2001-12-10,4,"My sister cooked a similar recipe except she uses bacon instead of beef. After trying this one I would say I would prefer this one but, I would say you could even try to add chicken."
6434,2255,2001-04-02,5,This is so good cooled or hot
15609,2255,2001-09-26,4,This is a very good recipe for someone who is in a hurry or new to cooking.  Tastes different than my homemade but suprisingly Good!!!
17608,12207,2001-11-27,5,"These are fantastic!  I used 2 whole, dried Ancho Chilis instead of the powdered kind.  I just took out the seeds and threw them in.  Very good.  I love to find new recipes for country style ribs, this was great."
16346,12207,2001-12-16,5,WONDERFUL RECIPE!! I didn't have ancho chile so I used chipotle instead. Only thing is that it doesn't tell you when to add the sugar. I added it in at the tomato stage--turned out great.
10678,8956,2001-06-11,4,"This is really good, but the look is a bit strange. When I made it the balls looked like uncooked meatballs, which is unappetizing.  Next time i will lighten up on the t.paste. The flavor and texture is great!"
18391,6617,2001-10-30,4,made this once after a long day .. quick and simple
20075,12295,2001-11-27,5,These are really good. For Christmas you could put a few drops of red coloring in the frosting or use green cherries with green frosting. I will definately make these again.
4470,11824,2001-09-20,5,These are very good I make them all the time but instead of seasoned salt I use regular salt and then use Mrs Dash extra spicy or Tony Chachere's more spice (about a tbsp and a bit)
23581,14466,2001-11-20,5,These cookies are delicious. The nutmeg is what makes them so good. Highly recommend this recipe.
21694,13158,2001-10-30,5,This is a really great chicken dish.
22644,13158,2001-11-08,5,"Lots and lots of garlic, which was the best!"
16140,13158,2001-11-12,5,"Absolutely Delicious!I think I,de like to try the marinade with Pork Chops too."
14613,13158,2001-12-25,4,"this was really good; chicken was moist.  i would use a little let sea salt next time, though, as the sodium of the soy sauce and 3 tsp of sea salt put it over the salty edge."
18723,14873,2001-12-10,5,"Yes, it is absolutely yummy. The first time I made this, I made it exactly as written and loved it. The second time I made it, I added some diced chicken to it. It was just as good."
2046,5344,2001-05-20,4,"I didn't have grapefruit on hand, but used orange and onions and cilantro in the salsa.  Thought the marinade could have had a bit more effect on the meat -- I didn't taste it much.  Still, the dish turned out well. I also sauted some onions, orange, red and green peppers with a little cumin and garlic to make mini-tacos.  Would make it again."
6357,10961,2001-10-16,5,This is similar to the halva I regularly make. I will post it soon:)
21618,10961,2001-10-20,1,Not Impressive
6357,11643,2001-09-14,5,GREAT!!
22212,564,2001-10-28,3,I omitted the anchovy paste and used the same amount of Sofrito (a paste for soups and stews used in many of my Latin/American recipes)
21657,11076,2001-10-24,5,"I rated this so high for two reasons: 1, it was SO easy! 2, All of my brunch guests loved it!
I did, however, use frozen hash browns in place of O'Brien potatoes. I also added some cubed ham with the broccoli, and used milk to mix with eggs instead of water."
11297,2731,2001-07-02,4,The man of the house really loved the sauce with this one.  Great:)
23302,15620,2001-12-18,5,I had unexpected dinner guests tonight and decided to try these carrots. They got rave reviews and disappeared like a snowflake on water.
24296,14035,2001-12-06,4,Looks   so  good!!!!  my   boyfirend  Loves  all  kinds  canded  fish. he  could  eat  it  avery night!!!  thanks  so  much  for  the  recipe. Ginny Ross
12125,8794,2001-07-05,5,Wonderful! Much better than the same old Pasta Salad. So simple too! Perfect with any BBQ food.
9097,2940,2001-05-07,5,awesome!!!!
19994,2940,2001-09-27,5,"Excellent punch.  We didn't try it out before hand, but it received rave reviews from all the attendees."
21388,2940,2001-10-16,5,used at the last minute and everyone enjoyed. easy to make.
8000,9228,2001-08-29,0,"Works with any other veggie, too."
15609,9228,2001-10-01,5,This is very good.  I would have never tried those spices with Brussel Sprouts.  I'm going to try with other veggies.
26611,15796,2001-12-19,4,"What a hoot! My friend and I , in doing our holiday baking, found this in an old book and tried it. We got silly and misread the recipe so mixed the nuts into the dough. We both like coconut so added a small handful to the mix. We then used pineapple jam in the dent. They are easier if popped into the fridge for about half an hour, but not really necessary. Absolutely fabulous....... These gems will decorate the plates and delight the palates of both our homes and workplaces this Christmas. Try them, with or without our changes and you will be pleased."
6357,2673,2001-11-13,4,Lovely!!
26194,4523,2001-12-14,5,This is the best food i have ever eaten!!!
3505,201,2001-06-19,4,"Delicious!  Somewhat of a surprise, as I was not sure how the citrus would react with the Halibut.  Try it with a wild rice recipe or rice pilaf."
19412,201,2001-10-01,4,I made it for company.  Easy and very tasty.
12174,7537,2001-07-05,4,Its great for any type of pie. I would use a 9 inch pie pan.
9145,287,2001-05-07,3,"i had the privelage of dodging the draft in brasil when i was a young man.  I loved the food, the people and the language.

my only regret with your recipe was the use of turkey sausages.............i just couldn't get behind it.

maybe i'll try again soon.
 muito obrigado.......

15243,287,2001-08-21,5,I'm brazilian and we eat a Feijoada at least once in a month. It's worth the trouble of finding all the ingredients and cooking it. You'll like it.
10664,280,2001-06-06,5,My spanish girl-friend gave me this receipe. We like it cold and warm (especially) and with a cup of milk.
10878,280,2001-06-11,4,"I've made similar recipes in the past and I think it should be understood how long it takes to cook the potatoes and onions in oil.  I figured at least a 1/2 hour, if not more time.  The recipe is very authentic though, and I usually make it with one less potato. The suggestion to have some oil in the pan before you pour the eggs is VERY important.  Thanks for the recipe!"
14059,280,2001-09-10,4,"Good, but I wouldn't try it for breakfast. I think this is a brunch kind of thing. Takes a little too much coordination to work early in the morning ;)"
23701,280,2001-11-15,5,This recipe is extremely easy to make and tastes excellent!  I believe that it tastes best when served in a bun or roll.  This is how I ate it while in Spain and it seems like the Spaniards know what they are doing!
10216,2802,2001-06-16,5,Great...I've been looking for a decent bravas recipe for ages!!!
20754,10698,2001-11-25,4,This stuffing recipe is very good and it is very moist!  It's a keeper for my family
2312,10698,2001-12-08,5,"Ooey gooey just like I like my stuffing.  This was a hit on Thanksgiving even though -- sacrilidge -- cooked entirely outside of the bird.  I bought a couple of loafs of cheap white bread, which worked perfectly.  There was enough left over to make turkey sandwiches on white bread with gravy afterwards ;-)  I might have just sworn off all ""fancy"" stuffings for good."
16408,62,2001-10-25,5,"This recipe was awesome! I took it to a family reunion, and it was gone in minutes!"
14613,62,2001-11-20,4,"the combination of ingredients is smart, but this recipe as is desparately needs some sea salt and balsamic vinegar for that extra kick."
7562,2987,2001-04-09,5,"I made a few changes-added more chili powder and cumin and some cayenne pepper, and sauteed and cooked the green pepper with the onions. Also had great luck using canned black beans.  This is unbelievably good!!!!  Better double the receipe."
22391,2987,2001-10-29,5,"This is a great chili. I made a few changes to a double recipe. I substituted venison tenderloin, boar chops and ground elk which were all grilled over apple wood, canned black beans and a teaspoon and a half of habenero pepper flakes were added. The entire list of ingredients were heated in a skillet, portions at a time, then cooked overnight in a large crock pot. This chili won a second place trophy in a chili cookoff."
21432,2987,2001-12-05,5,"Best chili I've made. I had a little trouble cooking the black beans the first time (didn't seem to soften no matter how much I cooked them), so I substituted 2 cans of precooked beans per pound. This will become a regular."
10881,142,2001-06-11,5,"This cake was moist and tasty and stayed that way until all gone 2 days later. My non-cake liking husband gave it a ""4""! It was easy to make - my 6yr old and I used the full amount of almond extract and crumbled the toasted almonds by hand.  It's a great recipe for turning the ""yuck"" bananas into something yummy."
15003,2781,2001-09-18,5,These are wonderful - perfect for a sweet snack or for breakfast!
21204,2781,2001-10-28,5,"These are delicious!  I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, very good."
7883,605,2001-04-09,4,"being in a house hold of australian vegetarians it was neccessary to delete the meat from the menu.  this was their first time tring traditional british grub and they were all agreed to it's hidden delights.  i will certainly be using your recipes again, and hoipe to change the snobbish, ignorant attittudes of those who presume brittish food inferior.  thank you."
11586,9400,2001-06-25,5,"Excellant recipe! My little boy is so picky I just don't know what to fix anymore. I saw this recipe and thought, ""hey, why not"" and was I ever surprised, he loved it! Thanks, I am really a grateful mom."
12279,9400,2001-07-09,5,This is one great recipe! My husband said he could eat this at least 3 times a week.
1634,9400,2001-10-11,4,"I played around with this recipe and used about a third of a cup of fresh onions, diced very fine, and a half a cup of sliced salad olives. My grocery store sells pre sliced olives at a reduced price because the vendor can use less than perfect olives in these jars ... and hey if you are going to slice them any ways .. why not !!

The loaf took 1 hour and 15 minutes to reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees, and 5 minutes of standing time helped the loaf absorb most of the excess liquid."
22585,9400,2001-10-31,5,Easy to make & DELICIOUS!My family loved it!The recipe is perfect as is.Thank you for this recipe!
11688,912,2001-09-14,5,"It actually tastes like apple pie, but uses ingredients that you always have on hand so dessert can be made without going shopping.  
Also, it reminds me of my childhood when my Mother used to make this pie and serve it with
homemade ice cream.  Yummmmmmmmmm"
8763,5454,2001-05-10,4,This food is yummy i love the mixture of the ingrediants!
2059,5454,2001-09-11,5,This was very tasty.
15451,604,2001-08-30,0,"Correction regarding Ingredients
 Although these are not true English muffins as you would buy in an English  Cake shop[You cannot get them this side of the Atlantic] I would use this recipe. there is however one serious flaw in it, half way through it states. Turn out the dough and knead for a minute or two and then cut with a glass. This is extremely dangerous as a few years ago I was doing just that when the glass shattered in my hand. I was before I retired a professional cook and I have British professional qualifications.

4470,2734,2001-07-30,4,I love hamburgers and usually have at least one a week.  This was good! I added 3 crushed garlic cloves and it gave a bit of extra zip.
12305,556,2001-07-23,2,I didn't like this one.  Too much yeast for our taste.
5830,506,2001-03-16,4,This recipe is easy and my husband loved it.I t does make a lot though so be prepared.
7407,506,2001-04-09,4,Very Tasty!  I added peas and finely chopped carrot to add colour and vitamins.
8172,506,2001-04-24,4,"I was definitely impressed.  Usually I feel the need to ""tweak"" most recipes.  This one was fine, as is.  I served it with a tossed salad and home-made garlic bread.  Even my picky kids liked it.  It does make a large amount.  Enough for at least two meals for the four of us."
11561,506,2001-06-25,5,My family loves this meal! It is fairly easy and doesn't take too long to prepare. I have a large family and it is MORE than enough for the 9 of us!
16287,506,2001-08-23,4,Very good and easy recipe
15368,506,2001-11-25,4,"I substituted turkey - leftovers from Thanksgiving - cut the amount of milk by 3 ounces and added 3 ounces of white wine, used celery instead of green pepper, and topped with seasoned and crushed tortilla chips."
26596,506,2001-12-19,0,gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
17642,1035,2001-09-28,5,Great recipe. Easy to make.  Used recipe for a tailgate party and had enough to bring to work.  There will be no left overs for this recipe!!
6357,15909,2001-12-25,1,"Sorry, but I didn't like this. This was really really bad and a total opposite of what I'd imagined it to taste like. I even tried to improve upon it by adding Nestle cream and Nestle sweetened condensed milk but to no avail.
Really upset with this recipe."
7279,1128,2001-04-03,5,"It took me about a week after registering on this site to try out one of the recipes.
This was it.  I had a feeling I would like it when I saw the name.  That feeling grew when
I saw the ingredients.  I underestimated just how good it would be.  This is probably the 
best chicken recipe I have ever made.  It was simple, smelled phenomenal while it was
baking, and had a perfect combination of sweet and spicy... one of my favorite flavor
combinations.  I made one substitution.  I used four boneless, skinless chicken breasts
instead of the six thighs (which I assumed had bones). I made the sauce just how it
was in the recipe... Phenomenal."
8679,1128,2001-04-29,5,"I made this with breasts as well.  I left the skin on (removing any excess fat) to avoid drying it out too much.  It was great.  I served it to my family and they all loved it.  The left overs were even better the next day.  Very easy, quick preparation and looks lovely served with saffron rice and fresh green beans.  A great company dish."
10314,1128,2001-05-31,5,"Very flavorful and different(in a good way).  I added almost 2x as much spices and it was wonderful.  I will definetly make it again.
                                   Mel"
16459,10786,2001-10-05,4,I made this and had much better luck. It reminds me quite a bit of gumbo. I did add lots of hot sauce.
21752,10786,2001-11-05,4,"Very good, we had this for dinner last night.  I added some hot paprika to the marinade, so I guess we had the Cajun/Hungarian version."
4470,7455,2001-08-07,4,I just had this for lunch and enjoyed it.  I cut back on the Sesame Oil to 1 1/2 tbsp and added 3 tbsp dried veggie soup flakes. Very nice flavor
20084,10521,2001-10-23,3,"This was a nice dinner, but a little bland.  Probably because I used Healthy Choice Alfredo...."
10216,12988,2001-10-22,0,"Found her!!! it was chef Tara that posted on the BB about this method of cooking pasta, ir really does work... It depends on the pasta you are cooking, keep an eye on it, it will take between 10 and 20 minutes for your pasta to be al dente... she is chef number 12118, named Tara :)) thanks tara!"
21752,12988,2001-11-18,5,"I made this with raddiatore pasta, no olive oil, lots of butter, and this could become my new comfort food!"
21752,12567,2001-11-05,4,This is a very easy and satisfying recipe.  I added some craisins (dried cranberries) for more flavor and color.
20828,6951,2001-12-22,4,"Easy to do....delicious.  I am going to add 1/3 of the flour in triticale flour for it's nutty, full flavor in my next batch.  Warren"
17608,15347,2001-12-10,5,"I can't believe how easy and good these are!!!! I used bite-sized Milkey Way candy bars in the ones I made and they were fantastic.  Thank you Lennie, I'm so glad you found that great estate sale, I am definitely reaping th benefits."
10310,4267,2001-05-29,3,"Simple, easy-to-make and tasty. Even tastier if you add finely minced lightly browned onion to taste, one beaten egg and two tablespoons of flour. Best if fried (sauteed) in bacon fat. This is not really healthful but the taste is extremely good for your soul."
5898,3110,2001-02-16,5,"Hello!  My family used to use chicken feet in our soup and it was wonderful.  I was raised on a grain and dairy farm, we raised everything, processed our own meat, canned all our own vegetables etc.  It's so nice to come across all these wonderful recipes.  June Bug"
7449,3110,2001-04-02,0,How could anyone actually eat something so dirty? Please tell me why when we can eat chicken breast or wings would anyone choose to put this in their mouth!
5999,3110,2001-07-02,5,"My Grandma use to say that ""we ate everything, but the cluck"".  I'm sure that would include chicken feet!"
13021,3110,2001-08-29,5,'Delicious' is an understatement!  I'm serving these for company!  Hot diggity!
24217,3110,2001-11-27,0,So....how does one obtain chicken feet??  Other than whacking 'em off by yourself that is.  I can just picture the face of the butcher at my local Food Lion when I ask where the chicken feet are!
12200,10019,2001-07-09,0,This recipe is so easy to make.  Nothing smells and taste better than something made from apples in the fall of the year.
11674,4267,2001-07-09,0,"You should note that the butter and the corn flake crumbs were not factured into the nutritiona facts. To keep this low fat the potatoes could be mashed with reduced fat chicken or beef broth which will give added flavor.  I use I Can't Believe It's Not Butter SPRAY instead of the butter.  If you are using the corn flake crumbs mix spices with them. Such as seasoning salt, garlic powder or dill etc. Or you could use Shake n Bake."
1773,190,2001-01-29,3,this was okay.  too greasy for my tastes.
7961,190,2001-05-14,0,"My only comment would be that it looks is if I should have kept out the 1st patch of  meat cooked and used the remainder to simmer for 2 hours because if I used all the meat I did not have anything to bring to a boil it was to dry.
just my thoughts."
10649,190,2001-12-11,3,"I agree with gay. Also too many ingredients makes a dish too complictated, I would say a few of the spices could have been left out. It had a nice flavour though!"
11044,2032,2001-07-05,4,I made this on a rainy day when we couln't barbecue.  I used 1 pound of chicken and the amount of sauce was perfect.  The sauce itself was spicy and sweet. I used ketchup and added 2 tablespoons of tomato paste.
19893,2032,2001-12-06,3,"I made this one evening after our grill mysteriously ran out of gas.  It was a good dish ,but next time I will cut down on the amount of water used.  Had a very interesting flavor, sweet, yet spicy.  Worth a try."
6702,11702,2001-10-03,5,"Very good recipe, and easy too. I did omit the extra water that was called for and still had MORE than enough liquid to make the sauce.
Next time I think I will reduce the sauce by half before adding the rest of the ingredients."
16676,14522,2001-11-21,5,out of this world ..fantastic ...
16758,11100,2001-10-22,1,"i really did not find it to be that good,i had 4 people over they all said the same thing"
11543,2841,2001-06-21,5,Excellent sauce.  Good use of excess rhubarb. Meat was very moist and tender. I substituted juice for the cranberry-apple concentrate and reduced the liquid.
10896,1155,2001-07-05,5,I tried it for a picnic on sunday and it was gone in a half an hour.
6614,469,2001-03-19,4,"This Irish Soda Bread was just like I got in Ireland every morning for breakfast!
It was great!
I think next time I make it I will add just a pinch of table salt. 

It was quick and easy to make and it went well with corned beef and cabage.  
This bead should also go great with the Beef Stew with Guinness Stout also a great recipe."
6245,809,2001-03-05,3,"Mine came out really bitter.  Doesn't taste too good on its own, but lovely with herbed garlic butter."
25095,809,2001-12-03,5,"I add more veggies and more stout, and cut down on the beef stock... green beans and carrots, potatoes and a little bit of cabbage. Best thing about this recipe is that you can mess with it as you like...nothing's set or required (beside the Guinness of course! :D )"
9006,2770,2001-05-02,5,Considering I have nothing to compare it to. It took me over an hour and a half to find one recipe for Mulberry anything. It was great you have a great site here. Thank You If you could find a Mulberry wine recipe i would greatly appreciate it. Thanks again Lisa
12657,464,2001-08-05,5,"Wonderful recipe! Just the right amount of coffee and honey, and it's not too heavy either. An excellent variation of the usual cold-coffee :)"
11800,9526,2001-06-26,5,"New to the group, this is the first recipe I tried... and I'm sold!  This was simple, inexpensive, and absolutely delicious!!!"
7802,9526,2001-10-01,5,"Easy to make, inexpensive, excellent flavor. The chorizo really adds to the dish, which tastes just like tamales."
12716,9526,2001-10-19,5,The best tamale pie I have eaten. I baked it as a casserole dish in the microwave oven and it came out just fine. I froze individual 6 oz. servings in the freezer and reheated them in the microwave. I am preparing it again now for the second time but am making the portions bigger.
21399,9526,2001-12-04,5,Delicious and easy to make.  I think I might try it in the oven next time though.  Spread that very nice cornmeal topping around a bit.  I might also try some diced bell pepper or some mild green chilis when I do.  I enjoyed this meal last night.
10404,15775,2001-12-21,5,"I made this last night for tonight.  I added more olives and a bit of cayenne, and doubled the recipe.  I tried a finger full this morning and it's really, really good.  Thanks for sharing.  Di"
9869,15775,2001-12-25,5,"Another appetiser we had for our Christmas dinner, I used about a dozen olives and mixed it by hand, very easy very tasty."
4470,3805,2001-08-24,5,"Great recipe, very tasty with that touch of orange.  I put Craisens in with it and then when I was checking your recipes I saw you had an apple/cranberry recipe.  Thanks Tonkcats!
--------------------
I used your recipe again only this time I made it with Summer Squash.  I peeled and cut up the squash baked it covered for 15 min. Mixed in all the other ingredient and baked for 25 min. Delicious. Oh I used lemon peel instead of Orange and added the craisens.  MMmmmm"
16707,3805,2001-09-11,5,"I made this for my sweetie and he said it was definetly a keeper. I copied on a recipe card and that the recipe we will be using for acorn squash for now on.
Thanx"
18450,3805,2001-10-24,5,"This recipe is outstanding. For my own little touch, I added a few dates to the filling. Thank you for a great recipe!"
20238,3805,2001-11-19,5,This recipe was fabulous!  I haven't eaten a lot of acorn squash in the past but this recipe intriqued me so I gave it a try.  My husband and I both loved it!  I did make it for only two but made a generous amount of the stuffing to fill them.  This is a keeper recipe.
13483,11299,2001-10-20,5,Just a great soup!!  Easy to do and really tasty.  I did it in the microwave.  This prevented it from sticking to the bottom of the pot.  Nice thick and hardy soup.  Glad to add it to my recipe book.
14412,9990,2001-08-15,3,Hurray for Aunt Edna!!!! My Grandmother made they this way and now I have the recipe to carry on have been searching the web for the missing link all say to saok this I know was not the way we did it we picked and canned. Thanks again. Sharon
17637,9990,2001-09-04,5,"Easy, family loved them"
13063,15655,2001-12-31,0,"Just made up a batch of this, and added to one of my mini-loaves the fresh juice from half an orange- great addition, adding just a hint of citrus and a light, refreshing taste!"
21694,9684,2001-10-28,4,Very good.
1773,649,2001-02-01,4,interesting. i added celery and some cilantro.  i think i made it a bit too hot though.
21694,14354,2001-11-16,5,These were absolutely fabulous for lunch.  These were great because they were easy to make and quick.
13680,10622,2001-08-21,5,"Thank you, I am bringin this dish to a picnic tomorrow! Sincerely Debbie R"
23130,10357,2001-11-26,3,"not a bad BBQ recipe....but it lacked flavor. Not enough marinade I suspect.However, I would do it again."
9027,8132,2001-05-03,5,"This was a very simple recipe, that makes a fabulous product.  In exchange for a few tedious minutes of apple peeling, your reward is a pie that will recieve high praises from all.  The initial apple-blueberry combination sounds odd, however the end results will shock, and please your taste buds!"
6357,8132,2001-06-05,4,Liked it!
19799,12449,2001-10-08,5,"My grandmother also made this wonderful dish.It was the only way she could get her kids to eat cabbage.Same as with my mother,and now with my own kids.This stuff is pure comfort food."
15609,11030,2001-09-23,5,VERY GOOD !!!  Just like what I've had in Chinese restaurants.  Thank you Bergy !!!
20075,11030,2001-10-15,5,Made these wings to take for tailgating at a football game. They were really a hit and better than the real hot wings.
21487,14971,2001-11-30,0,Any particular kind of beer? *hahahahaha
20895,14971,2001-12-06,0,Your Favorite Beer!!!!!! LOL!!!!!
10823,8556,2001-07-31,5,This Recipe was wonderful. My family ate it up and then wanted more.
3856,531,2001-01-29,3,average taste. Not particularly subtle
10263,9488,2001-06-25,4,I have been using this recipie for a while now...its delish and a good winter standby when you can't think what too prepare for dinner.  Even the kids love it.
15645,10626,2001-08-30,5,Easy to make; works very well and is pleasing to the eye when you replace the dill pickle with red bell pepper. Next time around I would increase the curry portion; not enough.
21267,10626,2001-11-30,4,"This was pretty good, I just made it an hour ago and it's very different from the ones I've usually tried. Thanks for sharing this recipe! =)"
21694,14151,2001-11-20,5,"I made this great dish for a light, simple meal.  It was fabulous."
13778,10286,2001-08-06,5,This stuff is good. Gave me the energy I needed!
6357,10286,2001-08-29,5,"Its lovely but then how can one exercise after having so much? 
Once an hour has passed after exercising, I''d love to have this!"
4470,10580,2001-08-15,5,Excellent!  I used fresh spinach and noodles.
25010,10580,2001-12-04,4,Overall it was good. The Sundried Tomatoes and Garlic added some flavor but there seemed to be something missing.
6357,15435,2001-12-11,3,"I had this for dinner tonight. Normally, we just have noodles with lots of vegetables in it when in the mood for the same. Tonight, it was a little different with this recipe in hand. It was nice having mushrooms tossed in as well. Instead of cilantro, I garnished it with spring onions(my favourite!). The vegetables I added to the noodles were 2 capsicums, chopped, 1 carrot, chopped, 50-75gms onions, 1/2 cabbage and 100 gms French beans. Try it with these, it'll be more delicious!! I omitted the Chinese wine as I don't have it at the moment and haven't used it till date."
11119,1600,2001-06-18,4,"Yummy with a cup of tea, or in the kids lunchbox."
5689,5476,2001-02-12,5,Wow!!!  Egyptian food!!!  Cool!!!
21694,5476,2001-10-22,4,Very good.
24296,10543,2001-11-25,5,sounds  so  good.  my  boyfirend.  would  love  this  one.  great  for  a  fast  dinner.
20296,13407,2001-11-06,4,It was very good - not too sweet.
19799,8765,2001-09-26,4,"Good recipe,the biscuits were very tender and raised nice.Definately will make these again."
16140,11482,2001-09-21,4,"This was very tasty.I did,t have Creole Mustard(i,m not sure if we can get it in S.Africa so I used aTarragon one."
13778,10342,2001-08-06,5,"Made this for a get together and there was nothing left! 
Wonderful!"
15609,10342,2001-09-23,5,"This was VERY good, and easy.  My favorite combination.  There were no leftovers at our house either.  I added a little minced garlic and I cooked the chicken in a baking dish in half a can of chicken broth, I didn't add the other ingredients until the chicken had cooked a little, then added the cheese, and diluted the soup with the other half can of broth.  I also instead of ""topping"" the chicken with the stuffing mix, put it between and all around the chicken.  That way, you could see the chicken, and the stuffing."
20519,10342,2001-10-05,5,"Thank you.  This recipe was terrific.  I made it for my mother in law's birthday dinner and everyone seemed to like it.  I followed the direction of the other review and also added chicken broth and a small amount of minced garlic. My Mother in law asked that I make it for any future family parties. Big hit, no leftovers!"
27323,10342,2001-12-28,5,I halved this recipe and made it along with Christine's Southern Party Potatoes. I had NO leftovers! Terrific!!
7504,8688,2001-04-09,4,The main suggestion I will make about this recipe is you really should double it!!You will be surprised at how fast they go. Once you start eating it is hard to quit. YUMMY!!
6357,8688,2001-06-04,4,"My brother loves this!!
Thankssssssssssss so so much for sharing it!"
16843,8688,2001-08-29,4,"Was excellent, I also added little tomato ketchup and corn flour."
17655,8688,2001-09-04,5,The wings sound great. I am definately going to try them.
20236,8688,2001-10-01,5,"This was great, didn't have the wing but made it with chicken breasts, was just great!!"
19008,10300,2001-09-23,5,"Very Addicting! :-)
Made them to go with lasagna."
13483,10721,2001-12-31,5,"Fast, simple, easy, do ahead and great taste. How can you loose?? I served this in a wine glass and dusted it with some chocolate. I used a heaping tablespoon of frozen orange juice concentrate and it worked very well. Next time I may add some skinned orange wedges. Excellent!

Just wanted to add that this is even better if you make it and then freeze it.  Have done this one many times."
2781,1396,2001-09-06,5,The turnovers are fantastic when warm. Even the rice is great just as a side dish.  I used a mixture of wild rice and regular long grain.
21752,135,2001-11-08,5,"Amazing!  This reminded of the Hostess Fruit Pies I used to have as a kid in the States.  We also tried it with apple pie filling, which really hit it big with the adults.  The kids prefer cherry or blueberry."
15572,361,2001-10-07,4,I added a touch of Marsalla and some roasted cashews for crunch.  Terrific!
20497,361,2001-12-13,5,"This is one of the richest and Creamiest Alfredo I have ever made. And it is so easy, no more Jar sauce for my family"
21618,10968,2001-10-20,1,This is unimpressive
16140,380,2001-09-25,4,Very nice.I substituted the orange rind for lemon and added another 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.
13138,432,2001-07-24,5,this is the easiest pie to bake  it really sound good i will be baking it very soon
15368,432,2001-08-21,5,This one takes blueberries and raises it to a new level.  Absolutely the best I've ever made.
21627,490,2001-11-29,5,Really wonderful blend of flavors...very original. The orange and coriander really jump out at you and the currants provide a bit of sweetness. I added a red bell pepper to the mix. I'll be making this one a lot. Thanks for the recipe!
11109,9433,2001-06-16,0,yum
9869,13046,2001-12-25,5,"This was a real hit, and so easy!
Looks and tastes great, just a note for anyone making it, it doesnt mention in the directions when to add the sugar, simply beat it with the egg whites.
Delicious!!"
5285,194,2001-02-01,3,"Basic, simple - but it's good, and taught me a thing or two about making good thai (?) soup - never cooked with lemon grass, but it was yummy. Simple to make and wholesome and creamy without dairy, I'd forgotten the charms of coconut milk."
8805,349,2001-04-27,2,"I was planning to use the vanilla sauce just over a strawberry-rhubarb compote I had found
elsewhere on this site, but then I noticed that the directions do not tell me what to do with the 
beaten egg and 2 Tbsp. water (the last two ingredients).  ""Reheat, [should it read 'swirl in the
and water mixture into the'] vanilla sauce and stir"" ?
Hope you can correct this oversight!"
8580,242,2001-04-22,0,"""Any"" Muffin

What a great idea....will let you know how my banana muffins turn out.

thanks"
12657,2737,2001-11-27,4,"Very easy, filling, and rather unusual pasta dish; I hadn't realised how well spaghetti and yogurt go together. Next time I make it, I'd either double the amount of tomato paste, or throw in some chopped tomatoes just before serving, for that added fresh bite. Also, I felt the amount of oil was a tad too much... half would easily suffice, methinks. Thanks for a really unique recipe! :)"
6357,2238,2001-08-23,3,That's really cool just like Coco-Cola!!
5830,4560,2001-03-16,5,"These cookies have also been called ""magic cookies"" (without the butterscotch) on the back of the sweetened condensed mild can and they will give you the temp-- which is 350."
5060,13306,2001-12-10,5,"I made these last tuesday and hid them away in the freezer, they were found today and raved over! I only had chunky peanut butter and I did not have any chocolate kisses, but they loved them anyway!! Now I have to make them again, they're half gone!  thanks for a goodie!!"
18660,7715,2001-12-06,5,"So, so good... If you are looking for a good seafood salad that isn't aturated in mayonaisse, then this is a good recipe for you.  It has a Tex Mex flavor and hints of a favored dish called cerviche (minus the tomato sauce)"
6357,15412,2001-12-10,4,"Excellent! Today for the first time, I made this tea. I ended up with 2 1/2 cups and not 1 cup as has been mentioned by you.
Moreover, the reason I took away 1 star is that, the taste was ""phika"", a little more sugar is necessary, I would say, about 2 1/2 tsp. sugar instead of 1 tsp. is perfect!
Overall, very well written recipe with simple, easy to follow instructions."
17868,3180,2001-09-04,5,"This is an easy, dependable recipe.  Every time I make these I get rave reviews. Plus, you can substitute the raisins with butterscotch chips for a nice twist."
15609,11489,2001-09-19,5,"My whole family loved this.  Very, very good."
13513,153,2001-07-31,4,"I use applesauce instead of the oil and it is not only delicious, but less fattening."
2625,9242,2001-06-26,0,I only got one star! Whatever...she must not have even made it.
17344,9242,2001-10-01,4,"Also works well with Bartlett Pears, but I liked how the recipe turned out with the Bosc Pears."
21694,14346,2001-11-16,3,"Has a good taste, but it was a little thick to cook the veggies in."
9690,12094,2001-09-27,0,I went to a recipe exchange and this one was a favorite
16774,64306,2001-08-29,4,this is extremely easy and very nice.  children would have no trouble making this recipe... good for beginners
25988,15154,2001-12-12,0,I have found these cookies to be a little salty tasteing so instead of 1/2 tablespoon I use a 1/2 teaspoon.They are great.
24936,15154,2001-12-17,0,"I've been baking for longer that most of you have been alive! This recipe is the BEST I've ever had the pleasure of making and especially eating. But I do agree, there was a tad bit of a salty after-taste, so I suggest that you reduce the salt in half. I only wish they lasted longer. I'm off to make a new batch. Ta Ta..."
6357,15154,2001-12-20,3,"These were pretty okie. They were chewy, soft and nice, the only problem was the salt. I added 1/2 tsp. and still feel it's more. I'd suggest to use 1/4 tsp. I baked these in 3.5 minutes !"
17803,15154,2001-12-25,3,"These puff up a lot during baking.  So started to make them smaller after the first ones came out of the oven. I miss read and used 1/2 tsp of salt, sounds like that was the right thing to do."
2312,9023,2001-11-06,4,"I omitted the sugar and used chicken stock instead, these are true blue greens.  Doesn't get easier or tastier."
27285,13596,2001-12-27,5,VERY VERY Tastee!!!
26623,12329,2001-12-19,0,"We used to make these as kids at home all the time and ate them up fast as you please.  I'd forgotten how to make them over the years, and since Mom's now passed away, had no way of knowing how to make them again...until now.  Thank you so much for posting this delicious and easy recipe.  Takes me right back to being a kid again. We also made them without the peanut butter; or left the cocoa out, and added more peanut butter. :)"
2059,12472,2001-10-08,5,I sure never ate these in Naples but they were good for sunny afternoons in Massachusetts too.
21694,12472,2001-11-20,5,"Like the last reviewer said, these are absolutley fabuous for a sunny lunch outside.  They are easy to make and don't keep you slaving in the kitchen.  They have a great taste and are a must try."
5523,7695,2001-02-01,1,I agree.
14583,13690,2001-11-06,4,I love potato salad but on low sodium diet the regular kind is too high in sodium   this sounds great and will try it this coming week.... hope I enjoy it as much as regular  thanks
22658,11763,2001-11-01,5,This recipe was quick and easy and delicious. I use it to make several pound cakes for my church.
17608,11763,2001-11-02,5,"I love this, super easy, everything is already on hand.  Terrific!"
22836,11763,2001-11-23,5,An exellent and simple recipe!!
25267,14836,2001-12-04,5,The best apricot recipe I have tried because it is so simple.
9869,14836,2001-12-11,5,"Definitely 'fantastic' and 'yummy', I used one large chicken breast for 2 servings, cut down on the cornflour, and only had the apricots and not the nectar. Just added a little water instead, and was still a 5* recipe. Also had it with rice instead of pasta. Thanks for posting  =)"
19719,5000,2001-10-09,5,Absolutely wonderful! I pinched off the dough instead of rolling it (easier that way)
10113,5000,2001-11-12,5,"This was very good all of my familey loved it.
I added 2 diced stalks of celery,2 diced carrots and 1 small onion diced to the water and chicken befor it was cooked for extra flavor."
22920,167,2001-11-23,4,Very good recipe!  It taste terrific!
6702,536,2001-04-02,3,"The corn dog casserole tasted a lot like baked cornbread stuffing. I liked it and would eat it again, but it was a no go with the 10 year old. My four year old picked out the hot dogs but left most of the breading on her plate.
Also, it had to cook longer than indicated here. After 45 minutes it was done, so when you try the recipe, give yourself more time than stated."
7697,536,2001-04-04,1,"This was a huge let down for my family. I think if there was not as much sage, it might be ok. But not one single person in my family liked it. I don,t mean to be negative, but honestly, this dish was awful."
8208,536,2001-04-13,4,I like to make new dishes for potluck so I tried this recipe.  Everyone thought it was great and thought it was a fun and different kind of casserole.  You need to add Ketchup or BBQ sauce on the finished casserole to bring out the flavors - just like with corn dogs on a stick.
16951,536,2001-08-29,5,I cut this recipe in half since its just hubbie and me. Took a little longer than listed to bake (more like 35-40 minutes). We both LOVED it...no other acoutriments needed...served with cole slaw.
8681,1580,2001-04-24,4,"Thank you, I have been looking for this type of recipe. We used to rool the dough into 2 rounds and add an almond filling between the layers!"
10275,8801,2001-05-29,4,love it
8632,8801,2001-06-26,0,tastes amazing!
1634,9115,2001-07-05,5,"A sweet/sour dressing with a little punch ... I really like this one.  I have just added this dressing to just enough sour cream to make a dip for chips. I also smeared the dressing/ sour cream mixture on a couple hot dogs, and both experiments were Great!!
"
13483,9115,2001-09-04,5,For my taste I added a little extra garlic to this terrific recipe.  It is very versitile.  Glad you posted it for all to share
19008,10276,2001-09-13,5,I found that this recipe tastes even better the next day.
20207,10276,2001-10-01,5,Great receipe! I added coconut flakes.
22708,10276,2001-11-05,4,easy to make and tasty
12657,11343,2001-11-29,5,"You've hit upon the perfect combination of ingredients to make this the best tomato chutney I've tasted! I had it with toasted bread, and it also goes really well with idlis and dosas. One thing to remember: Remove the bay leaf before blending; stray bay leaves can really mess up a recipe!"
4470,14589,2001-11-23,5,Quick Easy and tasty! I had these on a buffet style luncheon and they went over BIG TIME and very good looking.  I added a bit of Peri-Peri (just a few drops) to the filling Thanks Dorothy for another good one
14613,9544,2001-10-29,4,"Pretty good. I'd go easy on the capers, though."
6164,15866,2001-12-17,0,This tastes so good that I felt like rating it myself....excuse me for the indulgence...now you gotto tell me about your experiences :-)
12568,445,2001-07-13,5,It was very good. Easy to make that was the best part.
26455,15372,2001-12-17,4,"My cousin has made this recipe a few times. It is so simple, but soooo good!!  At first I was unsure...saltines?  Don''t worry, it tastes fantastic!"
16818,445,2001-10-07,5,"Easy to make and absolutely delicious.  A perfect combination of moist, sweet and tart tastes. This will certainly be a recipe that we will use often."
11119,444,2001-06-25,4,"These were really good.  I substituted the Just Right for a cheaper cereal and they turned out great.  Just be careful with the measurements though, because they really are moist."
5790,595,2001-02-12,4,"great receipe!!!!! my mother raised 7 kids with this one. she perked it up with a simple white sauce made with flour,milk,and butter,poured over right before serving."
19702,11390,2001-10-02,5,Awesome and super moist.
21752,11390,2001-12-04,5,"I whipped up a batch of these last night, using all brown sugar instead of half white, half brown.  The few that were left this morning were quickly fought over by my daughters wanting to take them to school."
2059,11390,2001-12-17,5,These are great!  I just finished making a batch for a potluck tonight and I'm eating one as I type this review.  I agree with John; they are very moist.  Just a couple of notes: I used 1 tsp. vanilla (the amount wasn't specified in the recipe) and I mixed the peanut butter in with the shortening and sugars (step #3).
6357,11642,2001-09-14,5,hmmm .... great!
19634,11642,2001-09-23,5,"When I fixed this my family went crazy over it!!
Thanks for recipe."
21552,11642,2001-10-18,3,"I make a similar recipe, but use NO oil to soak the chicken. Instead, I use spray oil just before putting it in the oven. Seems healthier to me."
9869,11642,2001-11-20,5,"This is delicious! I only used 6 pieces of chicken and cut back a little on the hot sauce and butter, we really enjoyed it, thanks for posting.  =)"
20835,11642,2001-12-13,4,"this was awesome... i've got other ""oven fried"" recipes... but this one beats them all."
24957,13251,2001-11-29,5,"Moist, tasty muffins and they're easy to make. Everybody LOVES them and the chopped apple is marvelous in them."
21262,10136,2001-10-20,5,"This IS dreamy!  I made it this morning using 2 Braeburn + 1 Golden Delicious, 8oz of crushed pineapple and no almonds.  Hope the apples are still nice and white when the company comes!"
5523,8652,2001-10-18,0,like i said mmmmmmmm good. try it. you wont be sorry.
14433,9818,2001-12-25,4,Very nice Thai taste.
20501,12482,2001-10-18,5,"when i seen this recipe i did not no what to think,the mayo threw me off,but it was the best meal i have had in along time,it is very very good ,but i use more mayo thank you for the recipe/////great"
17815,12482,2001-10-28,5,I must admit this did not sound like it would be but when made it has the best mixture of taste. I had a house full and tried it. I had at least 15 people over and 1 out of the fifteen did not like it becuase of the peas. Great recipe. Thanks
18977,3842,2001-10-15,4,"Only comment I have is ""DO NOT flip a drop of water into the hot fat!!!""
You will end up splattered with hot grease!!!

The ONLY TIME you flip a drop of water into a hot skillet is when the skillet is DRY.  That is the best way to check if skillet is hot enough to add oil...and if you do check the skillet this way prior to frying any type of meat, the meat will not stick!!!"
6357,8911,2001-08-08,0,Nutritious!
6357,14008,2001-11-12,2,"This was really not what I had expected it to be.
First of all, you've gone wrong with the measurements of the ingredients. I made this today, hence, I must share with you the correct measurements. I used 1 3/4 cup milk, 2 eggs and 6 tbsp butter(The remaining ingredients were the same in measurement as what you've mentioned in the recipe). Unfortunately, it didn't turn out as great as I'd hoped and imagined it to."
42189,4460,2001-02-12,5,"I have had this before. It has really good flavor!Be sure to use salted pretzels, they really make the dish good."
10693,4460,2001-06-06,5,"I made a variation of this recipe after a friend brought it to our baby playgroup.  It's delicious and a perfect summertime dessert.  Salty, sweet and refreshing!"
26346,4460,2001-12-16,5,"This is a family favorite. To save time, get the jello started first, using the quick-set method on the box."
13640,916,2001-08-02,5,"This is a great recipe, its small, quick and tastes great."
9157,2674,2001-10-11,4,"I think this is a decent bread recipe, but I think bread recipes with bread flour taste better.  If ya don't have bread flour this is the way to go."
14377,1593,2001-10-15,5,"A quick,easy, and delicious recipe."
4470,11878,2001-11-29,5,"Tebo. great easy recipe.  I put in 3 Jalapeno peppers, minced and put salsa on top.  MMMmmmmm  Thanks for a good recipe"
20754,12791,2001-11-23,5,This is awesome!! I created a punch with this recipe.  But I did use vodka instead of rum.
11523,3610,2001-07-11,5,easy to make and delicious
21132,3610,2001-11-05,5,"My family loved this recipe and it was very easy to make.  It was a little bit runny, but no harm -we just scooped up the sauce and piled in on top of some freshly toasted garlic bread.  Yummy!  My finicky daughter wants me to serve the sauce with pasta all the time now!  

Tip - Add a beaten egg and fresh parmesan cheese the cottage cheese to help firm it up a bit."
8335,8769,2001-04-22,0,"It's an all-natural lemonade. The classic. Why, you actually boil the lemons! The colour is orange, but the taste is lemonade. LeHmonade... mmm-mmm."
12657,8769,2001-07-25,3,"The rind made it little too bitter to my liking at first, but sugaring it up makes up for it... adding to the calories as well :)"
19043,5353,2001-09-24,3,We weren't crazy about this dish.  Would be good for kids.  I did like the bacon and it stayed crisp.
13483,5353,2001-10-28,3,This was a good substantial dish but I found it a little too salty!!  From the cheese I guess.  The bacon was a nice touch though.
25925,329,2001-12-23,4,I enjoyed this chili.  It was really good with tortilla chips.  I think next time I will make it a little spicier.
5067,198,2001-01-16,5,Great recipe for anyone who like it as close as it come to the real thing! Very simple to make and you can find all the ingredents in your local supermarket! I myself would cut back on the white pepper and add a little bit of hot oil (not to much)! I would also add about 1 1/2 tbls more of vineger. (or to taste) add a little more meat and you can serve with a bowl of white rice with steamed veggies for a meal of its own.
5227,198,2001-01-23,4,my family like the bamboo shoots whole. but we love your recipe
5519,198,2001-02-01,5,"My boyfriend and i were very pleased with this recipe. he is half chinese so he knows the good stuff. the only thing we changed was the amount of chili paste. we only put one tablespoon instead of 2. the soup is very very spicy with 2 tblsp's. other than that it was great. the flavor is awesome. my boyfriend said that it tasted just like his mom's. that is a great compliment.
amity"
12412,2691,2001-07-19,4,"I used this recipe last night and it turned out pretty well.  I can see where the sauce can become overly thick if too much starch is used.

Regards,
Kevin"
6127,170,2001-03-05,5,Our family found this recipe simply delicious and easy to make.
11297,170,2001-07-30,3,Not being overly fond of celery I substituted shredded cabbage.  A tasty & easy dish. Reheated leftovers were great on toast for another quick meal :-)
10275,8673,2001-05-29,0,love it!!!!
7251,8673,2001-12-04,5,Of course this is great! I loved it when you first made it for me 33 years ago.  All my family enjoys this recipe.  Thanks dear friend!  Elaine
7697,4244,2001-04-09,5,This is a great beverage for a dinner party. We loved these. It was so much better than a mix. The powdered sugar was the biggest surprise. It set the whole thing off.
2625,4244,2001-05-24,0,"Anything?

This is all wrong.  Who uses powdered sugar in Margarita's? What kind of surprise is this --""Hey, there's marshmallows in the jello! Yes!""

Drink NO beverage that changes any part of the word ""margarita"".  What the hell is coarsely cracked ice?

The f'in truth? Ok, ok:

Half the glass filled with crushed ice. Fill up to ice line with GOOD tequila (important). Splash of Grand Marnier. Add some fresh squeezed lime juice. Rub lime around the rim AFTER.  Salt is optional and is, well, useless."
17803,15507,2001-12-13,4,"Glad I found this one today! It was quick and easy and I was running short on time!  I'll fix rice next time to put the sauce on, instead of potatoes."
17803,5403,2001-11-13,4,Between the stewed tomatoes and sauce I used 42 ozs total.  On the pasta I cooked until al dente and I used 2 cups of frozen corn instead of canned.
19639,12165,2001-10-01,5,A lovely recipe any time of the year.  Serve warm or cold.  A great sidedish or maindish.  Use your imagination to add some protein to the sald. Mmm...I think I could handle another helping!
16140,11052,2001-10-01,4,"Very nice ,a lovely mix of flavours.as a small variation I added some finely chopped sundried tomatos whan I added the Oregano."
15368,11052,2001-10-25,4,"I added some sliced white onion, with some brine cured ripe green olives.  The lemon I increased to 1/2 cup.  Very delicious!"
26415,11052,2001-12-17,5,"It has a wonderful taste.  I found it very easy to make.  It says it only takes 25 minutes to make but I found it took longer.  Try adding carrtos to it, not only does it give it more colour but it taste great too.  If you are going to make it for 3 people, make the 4 serving one.  People will eat it right up."
22079,2643,2001-10-28,5,"Was happy to see this recipe.  Been making this for years now.  We call it Candy Apple Salad, but it's exactly the same."
8936,249,2001-05-01,4,this was a great recipe. You can also substitute the pita bread with a soft tortilla wrap or even just crackers.   Also you can substitute the lemon-pepper with garlic pepper.
20371,112,2001-10-28,4,"Three comments about this recipe. (1) It's absolutely delicious! (2) I was afraid there wouldn't be enough sauce, so I made 1-1/2 times the amount called for (i.e., 6 tbsp butter and flour, 3 c. milk, 1 can condensed chicken broth + 1 c. water, and I used 4 eggs) and I'm glad I did -- I used every bit. (3) The 15 min prep time listed is quite wrong...by the time I chopped the chicken, the broccoli, the onion, minced the garlic, grated the mozzarella, made the sauce ... well,you get the picture. It took me almost an hour to prepare. But it was well worth the effort and I will definitely make this again -- my family LOVED it."
10896,8309,2001-08-06,5,"I'm not a meat eater but the whole family LOVED this. Since it didn't say how much onion to use, I used 2 finely chopped."
22903,10412,2001-12-28,0,"I used a boxed brownie mix, crumbled it in the bottom of the bowl and then made the topping and put it on the top and it was just as good and took less time to make. 

Enjoy!"
13439,3576,2001-07-30,0,"Who would use this recipe with an intor like this? Too much fat, cholesterol and sodium. Recipezaar, you really goofed on this entry."
17987,3598,2001-09-04,4,"I wanted to give this 5 stars but since I'm supposed to be on a diet, it wasn't a very diet-concious choice. But i had it for the first time in St.Louis this weekend and it was absolutely wonderful!!!!!"
2059,3599,2001-08-29,4,"These were really good!  I made the ""basic"" (not thin or cakelike) recipe and, sure enough: they were neither thin nor cakelike.  Just good traditional chocolate chip cookies.  I got about 3 dozen medium-sized cookies out of this recipe."
19924,4140,2001-10-31,5,Awesome!!!
26146,14593,2001-12-14,5,"For some reason I have gone crazy this Christmas and decided to make an enormous amount of different kinds of cookies. I chose these because they looked like they would be different from any I had made so far.
They are TRULY addictive...I am almost burned out on cookies but these made me crave more! I recommend them hightly. Easy and delish. You won't be dissapointed.Thanks Nancy...these have already become a tradition."
10715,3616,2001-11-17,5,tasted great
2312,3616,2001-12-08,4,"Made this for Thanksgiving.  My guests all *loved* it.  I was reaching for my water glass a couple of times, because the horseradish was a little strong.  So if you are sensitive, add a little at a time til you hit your ""taste"" just to be sure."
7087,1267,2001-03-25,5,I am always looking for good chinese recipes and this is one of them!  It is a must!
2312,2886,2001-04-18,5,"I used one more banana than called for because I had it to use.  The result was a bread that was yummy, though a bit mushy.  We don't mind, but for guests I would have adherred more closely to the recipe, which is fantastically simple and delicious."
8639,2886,2001-04-24,5,I have been searching for a good banana bread recipe for over a year and I finally found it!  What a super simple recipe with excellent results!!!  Try it - You'll LOVE it!!
7890,2886,2001-06-04,5,I have tried many many banana bread recipes over the years - and this is the absolute best.
10979,2886,2001-06-18,5,"Yes, this really is the BEST BANANA BREAD!"
16171,2886,2001-09-04,5,Tried this recipe and the Grandchildren love it.Now I'm asked all the time to make this bread for them. I love it too.
15656,2886,2001-09-10,5,"5 stars baby!!! Bam!!! This is the bomb banana bread!!
the term bomb is a good thing :) Kids like it. Neighbor
likes it. Husband likes it. I like it. Thank you for sharing 
it!! :)"
9869,2886,2001-09-17,5,The smell of this when its in the oven!....wow....this is delish!!  =)
18920,2886,2001-09-23,5,"love it....
i put chocolate frosting with
almond bits and spred some 
cinnamon powder...yummy!"
19471,2886,2001-10-16,5,"excellent.  be sure not to keep it in more than an hour, its perfect at that time."
9581,2886,2001-10-22,5,Have tried many banana breads but this is one of the best.  I added walnuts to mine.  Would recommend this to anyone.  A winner for sure!
14880,2886,2001-11-06,5,"LIVES UP TO THE HYPE!  I only used 3 med. to large bananas and used 1/2 c. turbinado sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar, still turned out great.  Of course, flavor is even richer after a day or so."
19638,9774,2001-09-23,5,"Clever...interactive, fun for all!"
13483,2519,2001-10-04,3,Really very easy and quick to do.  It is a little too bland for me.  Maybe some nuts or seeds or chocolate would pick it up.  Still worth having in the cookbook.
24564,10619,2001-11-25,5,"good recipe, I'll have to try it."
26692,12140,2001-12-31,5,"This was by far the best turkey I have ever made this Christmas!  I used the liquid for gravy, adding only some flour mixed with water and it was excellent.  I would definately recommend it for any size turkey(mine was 20 pounds)."
1634,3624,2001-09-20,4,"This is a nice meal for three or, with a salad on the side, four people for lunch. Instead of spaghetti sauce from a jar, a cup of diced tomatoes ... out of the can is fine .. and a couple cloves of crushed garlic  will add a fresh taste to the dish and save some money. You might want to add a little salt."
22655,12538,2001-11-02,1,I was truly disappointed in this recipe. To begin with it is a mixture of Metric and US measurements. I adjusted the best I could configure and then some. It made a small amount of dough-not enough to even bother to cut. I just patted it out and baked it. Now granted the taste was good. I will look elsewhere for something similar.
8005,1303,2001-04-09,4,"This was a terrific cheesecake!  I substituted coconut extract for the almond extract,
and I also added about half of a cup of graham cracker crumbs to the crust mixture."
4312,3649,2001-01-03,4,"Ravishing and delightful, very easy to make."
2312,3651,2001-01-16,5,"I skipped the bread bowls and used fresh italian parsley, a little rosemary and thyme, and it was great.  Left it chunky too."
20130,3651,2001-10-08,0,"This soup is easy and quick to make. Including peeling and chopping all the veggies, and letting it simmer for 20 mins. it only took about 45 mins. from start to finish."
25582,15072,2001-12-08,5,YUMMMMM!!! So easy to make and SO yummy!!! I made them without nuts because my kids dont like nuts and it was scrumptious!!! I'll definately be making these again.
13483,11262,2001-10-02,5,"Wow  this was terrific.  It really was moist and tender.  I used a no fat mayo and this may be why it was so moist and tender.  Served with a baked potato and Christine's baked onions (posted on this site) and a salad, it made a terrific meal.  I will be doing this again.  Thanks for the recipe"
11077,8928,2001-06-15,5,"Very good desert,  moist and just the right amount of sweetness. I use it when ever rhubarb is in season."
10678,8928,2001-06-15,5,"Very good, I doubled recipe as I love rhubarb so much, this would be equally good with tart apples!"
4470,9021,2001-08-01,5,"Not only is the turkey great with the Jicama salsa the Salsa is a prize on it's own. You can serve it with so many other seafood and poultry recipes.  Thankyou for another ""Heart Smart"" tasty recipe."
21641,13385,2001-11-12,4,"My dad loves German Chocolate cake, so we're always looking for new recipes for him. This was easy to do and really moist. He loved it. Thanks."
21694,11648,2001-10-20,5,Absolutly delicious for a lunch or a light dinner.
9121,9401,2001-11-06,5,I omitted the yogurt and this was really tasty with pakoras.
25700,15183,2001-12-10,5,these cookies are simply wonderful and easy to make
12398,6776,2001-07-10,5,I have made this in the past and it is delicious!
23993,6776,2001-11-25,4,"I bought an expensive spring-form pan just because it looked cool & HAD to use it!!!  As a first time baker, this recipe was very easy & very tasty.  (A big hit with the boyfriend's family at Thanksgiving dinner!)  Tip:  1 hr & 10min. bake time was a bit too long, my crust was burnt and the topping a bit dry.  Next time I'll try 1 hr."
2312,11020,2001-10-03,5,lovely.  great color and crust on the chicken.  i threw a little of the spice mix in my couscous and shallots too. and served with acorn squash roasted with maple syrup.
17626,11063,2001-09-04,5,"Easy to make, very tasty and filling!!! My texan husband loved it..."
4688,3051,2001-03-16,5,"Haven't tried it yet , but it has to be great!"
24246,3051,2001-11-20,5,brill i'm 13c and i could make it with ease
20371,3058,2001-10-28,3,"I love worcestershire sauce, but the tablespoon called for in this recipe is far too much. The flavour overpowered the dish. Other than that, my husband and I both liked this, although my teenage son was not thrilled. I substituted 2 cups of ""winter mix"" for the frozen mixed veg (it's a combination of frozen broccoli and cauliflower my grocery store sells, essentially California Mix without the carrots) and suspect that 2 cups of any frozen veg would be fine. This was also quite easy to prepare, and made for a quick dinner."
10113,9732,2001-11-14,4,very easy and tatse good to my kids loved it
14451,10792,2001-08-15,5,The recipe sounds great.  Loved the combination. Squash and potatoes with onions.  The cheese adds a great tast to the veggies.  The recipe was stated very clear and easy to make.  Thanks you lane for this recipe.  You must be a good cook.
18391,14165,2001-12-06,5,"yummy!i once tried a similar recipe, but a lot more complicated .. this is easier *and* better!! i find it easier to roll the dough in your hands, then flatten it a bit and press the olive into it"
20160,14165,2001-12-19,1,I thought these were very bland.
10332,3083,2001-05-29,5,The Tortilla Lasagna was an excellent dish to make!  It was even better with sour cream and black olives on top.
6702,3084,2001-03-26,4,"This would be a five star, but I tend to reserve that rating for ""I died and have gone to heaven"" kinds of recipes. ::grin:: I make this same Shepherd's Pie, minus the savory in the potatoes, and it is really great. This children love it too, and I get begged for it a lot. When they get really lucky, and I am tired, I don't even make a green vegetable for the side. ::grin:::"
21913,11200,2001-10-23,5,This is also very very good with pork medallions.  Thats the way my family has always done it.  Great recipe!
21752,11200,2001-10-28,4,"I never thought of adding lemon juice to my schnitzel recipes, but I tried this and it was really good.  The only change I made to the recipe was to add lots of Hungarian paprika to the breadcrumbs."
16861,3143,2001-08-29,0,"I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I am very familiar with schnitzel, having lived in Germany for 9 years.  Rather than use veal in this recipe I suggest using boneless pork, which is what is used by the German restaurants I've eaten at here in the US use.  It's also my meat of choice when I make schnitzel.  Pork is light in color like veal, which also gives it an authentic look."
5607,3082,2001-02-04,0,This is great as a stuffing for celery
24345,13781,2001-12-15,5,"Excellent - I cooked this for my family with great results. We had leftovers that were soppose to be for the next day, but my son ate them for a snack."
10216,12948,2001-10-23,5,"WOW! I'd never used a base like that for a baked alaska... I always made a merengue base and ""filled"" it with ice cream, froze and then covered in merengue to cook... nice touch on it.
As a twist you could use choc chip mint ice cream... I'm sure that would make it even more amazing, although the contrast between the vainilla and the choc-mint base should be great.
I'll make this next time I remember to buy ice cream!!!!! (as in tomorrow) Added to my cookbook!!!"
4543,3251,2001-02-23,2,"I love Red Lobster caesar salad dressing.  I have looked the net over to find a recipe that tastes like it.  This recipe is alright, but to me still tastes NOTHING like Red Lobster's caesar dressing.  Guess I'll keep looking."
25119,15062,2001-12-03,5,My Mom makes this all the time with the leaf lettuce she grows in her back yard.  Must be a Southern Illinois recipe!
19799,15062,2001-12-28,5,My mom also made this recipe with the garden's first greens.Extremely fattening but sometimes you just gotta say what the heck!
9121,3091,2001-06-14,0,"It probably tastes really good, but what a STRANGE recipe!!  LOL!!"
10678,3091,2001-07-12,0,I just finished cleaning out our cats litter pan and have NO IDEA why anybody would want to RECREATE the look of it in a CAKE!!! this is definitely in the To-each-their-own category!!
14386,3091,2001-09-06,0,"I have to agree.I have no desire to spend that much time on something so disgusting,no matter what it tasted like!"
25691,3091,2001-12-08,5,"My sister-in-law runs a day care and makes this cake every year for Halloween. The kids beg for it! Granted, to the adults it may not sound very good, but the kids get a kick out of it."
6220,1823,2001-06-14,5,Darn Good!!
16140,1823,2001-09-04,4,Very *Moreish*Added a little dry mustard to the dough mix.
6271,7101,2001-03-05,5,"This recipe was delicious and fairly simple to make.  I used basmati rice.  Also, I browned the mushrooms and carrots before adding to the rice mixture.  I cooked the browned chicken and rice mixture in a dutch oven in the oven at 300 degrees  for an hour, as I had to leave the house and wanted it to be ready when I returned.  Also, I used some olive oil to brown the chicken and then some margarine to brown the mushrooms and carrots."
4470,6586,2001-07-30,4,"To me, basmati rice is the best.  Instead of water I use chicken stock. It adds a little more flavor"
6748,7356,2001-04-02,5,Great April Fool's day joke for the kids!  Fairly easy to make.
15547,7356,2001-08-21,5,"This recipe is fun and easy to make. I change the flowers depending on the season. In the summer time I use Vienna Fingers or chocolate chip cookies instead of the Oreos to make the ""dirt"" look more like ""sand"". I replace the flower pot with a child's beach bucket and shovel."
19799,10696,2001-10-12,5,This tasted like it came from a specialty coffee shop.Yummy!!!!
27176,10696,2001-12-26,5,this recipe tasted GREAT!!! it's so easy and i can't believe the results... i LOVE it!!
4464,11516,2001-09-10,5,"When someone calls and says ""Let's get together for a picnic or potluck"", this is a great recipe to make. It is easy and quick to make, the ingredients are usually on hand.  Now, to mention the taste???  It is a wonderful change of pace to a broccoli dish. The mayonnaise makes all the difference. I would recommend this recipe to everyone."
10075,3157,2001-05-24,5,"I love this recipe, and so does everyone who has every tried it..Delicious."
22898,8545,2001-11-05,5,Very spicy but I really liked the mingling of tastes.  I wouldn't add as much spice but it is excellent!!
17721,10184,2001-10-01,5,"This was easy and my whole family enjoyed it.
A nice twist using pineapples"
11688,1881,2001-10-15,5,"This recipe is almost exactly what my Grandmother called ""Boiled Cake"". 
She said it was originally ""made up"" because the ingredients for a regular cake were not
always available.  
This is one of my favorite cakes--great to take to a pot luck, or office party.  It tastes
wonderful, packs well and everyone loves it.
The only difference is she used lard, my mother substituted Crisco when they boiled the
sugar (they used white sugar), water, raisins, etc. together. And of course, they did not
always have nuts on hand so they were omitted a lot.
Wonderful cake!
Just a side effect -- when the mixture is boiling the entire house gets that spicy cooking
smell that brings the whole family into the kitchen saying ""what smells so wonderful)."
4470,11043,2001-10-08,0,I made a mistake last night I left the balls in the oven for almost double the time and they wer never better.  They were crunchy and I added a dab of hoy sauce to them. Bergy
21694,11043,2001-10-28,3,"Only OK, depends on whether you really like cranberries or not."
17608,3198,2001-10-25,4,"These were pretty good.  I'd never had them before, much less made them and they were pretty easy and very tasty.  The lemon/lime marinade is great."
10216,1904,2001-10-22,5,I just *HAVE* to send this to some friends for X-Mas!!! What a great fun gift for someone.
19021,1923,2001-09-17,5,This was pretty easy to make and very delicious. I have been searching for a recipe like this one for some time. I used canned pie filling and I am planning on trying cherry next time.
12491,10090,2001-08-15,5,"This is wonderful! I don''t like eggs, so I left those out and instead of pickles I used sweet relish.
Thank you for sharing this recipe!! :)"
6357,16110,2001-12-23,5,"Delicious! I licked the beater clean too while making the dough. I made the cookies this morning and had some tiny tots come over who said ""mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm gimme more"" for these cookies. Thanks a tonne for your timely help on making cookies and for sharing this fantastic recipe!"
21381,9539,2001-10-16,5,"It is a very tasty and easy stew to prepare.My family loves for me to fix it.I prepare it at least twice a month. Raeann M. Washington, Ind."
4470,12124,2001-10-28,5,Great recipe! I cut back to 1lb of ribs and it worked well.  I love your nice and quick recipes Tebo.  I also added a bit of Hot sweet Chili sauce.
21734,12124,2001-11-12,4,"This was a good recipe, although I cut in half with 2.5 lbs of ribs.

I also made up an additional mix of marinade, and brushed it on every 15 min. intervals while it was cooking. I think this kept the meat from drying out, and it was melt-in-your mouth tender without having to be covered.

Didn't have a beer with this one, but a nice light Weizen or a Japanese style Lager (Kirin) would go extremely well, and would balance the sweetness of the sauce quite nicely.

Served with an Iceberg wedge salad with Ranch dressing and some ranch-style beans (canned)"
13483,9556,2001-10-20,5,Excellent dish.  Nice to have stuffing without roasting a whole chicken.  Easy to do and went over well with guests.  Presents well too.  Thanks for sharing it.
21434,9556,2001-12-28,5,This is another keeper. This dish is so simple and easy to make; all of the ingredients blend and complement each other wonderfully.
13917,10741,2001-08-10,0,I know its my recipe but wow lots of give me this recipe from friends and can we have this tonight please!
5898,3273,2001-02-18,0,I had a Great Aunt that made the most wonderful dill pickles she told me that her secret was that she used rain water.  How interesting.  June Bug
10943,3273,2001-06-12,0,when canning any veg. it is best to use well water or bottled water instead of tap water because of the chlorine. I think on the garlic it means a clove instead of a head
10896,3273,2001-07-02,4,This was pretty good. the kids like them.
15609,2015,2001-10-01,5,"This is very good.  I used sausage though instead of beef or turkey. (I use sausage quite a bit for that ""EXTRA"" flavor)  I too put the rice in."
20076,2015,2001-12-29,5,My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much.  We love stuffed cabbage and this is much less work then stuffed cabbage is.  I highly recommend it.
5929,5230,2001-02-18,4,"I have made these and they are delicious, I also have made them with the Cherry
Chip cake - made by Betty Crocker.  Very easy and a different way of doing cookies."
4627,5230,2001-10-01,4,Very Good!  Everyone likes them.
12153,3294,2001-07-05,5,I added cayenne and increased the spiceyness but otherwise followed the recipe and it was great. Can't believe I made fried chicken (first time its been edible)!
17093,3294,2001-08-31,5,"Aha!  Someone stole my recipe!  I've been using something close (the recipe, not the method) to this for some time now and it is my favorite.
A couple of twists on the theme...
1.  I use a packet of powdered chicken bouillon in my flour mix for more savory taste....especially if you are using the frozen chicken parts.
2.  For one flavor variation of mine, I add about a tsp or less of curry powder to the flour mix...not enough for an East Indian taste, but as a nice spice.
3.  Another flavor is to crush just a small amount (a big pinch) of anis (anisette) in a mortar&pestle and add that to the flour.  This flavor is very popular here in the Caribbean...in fact I think this is one of the secrets of KFCs recipe.  Sounds weird, but try it!
4.  And, of course, MORE salt and black pepper!

25113,8060,2001-12-03,3,"this recipe took no time at all..total of 20 min maybe.  However it wasn't amazing..i think oven cooked meatballs taste dry. Regardless of the fact, on this particular day this easy recipe came in handy."
17803,4604,2001-11-23,5,Everyone liked this recipe the best.  There was only one thing I did different.  That being I removed the membrane from each section before cutting them up. (After removing the peel and the white bitter parts I thought I might as will go the whole nine yards and take off the membrane.)
16676,11392,2001-11-21,5,"if you like lemon ...this is the cake for you...melts in your mouth and so soothing..a really fantastic cake...for any time of the year..
a must to try..."
9875,4344,2001-06-14,5,This is so good.  Could not get enough.
12129,4344,2001-08-23,5,This is delicious!  I couldn''t eat my main course I ate so much of this!  It isn''t quite the same as olive garden (I think they bake theirs and put tomatoes on top) but it is quite yummy.
6357,9363,2001-06-06,5,"WOW!!!!!!

I love chocolates and thank you so much for putting such a lovely recipe online that too on the day when I won the SPRING contest here! I'll make this cake when I call my friends over for a party to celebrate today's thrill!
Thanks once again."
3934,2086,2001-04-22,5,This is wonderful. I made one batch for trial then had to make 15 more batches.Very easy and makes in just minutes.
11053,2086,2001-06-14,5,Thank you Thank you! I have been looking for this recipe for a while.  It's great!  I'm making batch of it for my father for Fathers Day
8021,2122,2001-04-09,4,Very easy to make.  Delicious as is or with one of the variations.
13483,10883,2001-11-01,5,"Forget the calories. . . this is good.  It makes a goodly amount as well.  I did this for halloween and was pleased to find not all of it was give out to the ghosts and gobblins.  It was my ""treat"" for halloween!!  Glad you posted this recipe."
19198,10883,2001-12-21,5,"Wow, this was delicious...but 10 min. was too long in my oven..I would start watching it at 7 min..will definitely make it again..thanks for sharing this recipe...C"
26359,15148,2001-12-16,5,Very easy to prepare.  It was the first thing to go at a potluck dinner!  This is my new favorite vegetable side dish!
25115,15148,2001-12-26,5,Delicious and easy to make
15609,10320,2001-10-01,5,This is very good and quick.  Add a salad and you've got a nice little meal.
20076,10320,2001-12-10,2,"We thought it was too dry.  Also, with the ingredients posted, I thought it would be more tasty then it was."
16949,11141,2001-11-01,0,I screwed up the recipe and my friend still said it was the best spaghetti sauce he has ever had.
8400,3333,2001-04-18,5,"This recipe is very tasty, and a big hit with the kids.  Make sure your cream cheese is soft before you mix it in or you'll have lumps.  If you don't have a flower pot on hand, a 9"" deep dish pie pan works well,too."
11498,2129,2001-06-20,5,"Delightful, and very moreish. Loved it, I have another version, but it is not as yummy!"
19676,3339,2001-12-31,2,"This brownie was a bit too ""cakey"" and dry in my opinion. It wasn't chewy or fudgey, the way I like brownies."
2312,3368,2001-09-23,5,Easy peasy and yummy.
23169,4769,2001-11-08,5,have not tried recipe yet but sounds great as every thing is available in Zimbabwe.
4684,8322,2001-01-16,2,Thai soup without lemon grass??....don't think so
23302,16193,2001-12-25,5,"Absolutely delicioso! I stuffed mine with crisp bacon, sauteed onions and mushrooms, Colby Cheese, Monterey Jack Cheese, Swiss Cheese, and seasoned it with seasoned black pepper and paprika. Can't wait to try your ""West Omelette"" recipe1 (Just kidding, Bergy)"
1634,16193,2001-12-27,5,"After it was folded over, I was treated to a double delight. A lightly browned pancake shell, and a soft fluffy egg center. I filled mine with shredded cheese that melted into a smooth creamy core."
20579,4323,2001-11-08,4,"Yummy! Everyone in my family loved it. I substituted pre-packaged pre-shredded mild cheddar cheese for the american cheese, just because it's what I had in the fridge. We also skipped the chili sauce, so I can't comment on that. The mustard in the recipe really gives a pleasing flavor boost. I had a hard time getting six squares out of my pie crust mix (Jiffy). There was just enough pastry, so I couldn't get the last two shaped like squares. Next time, I will use two boxes of pie crust mix and discard the scraps. If you do this however, remember to roll it out thin--about 1/16 inch. It helps to wet the edges of the pastry squares when you pinch the edges together. I served it with homemade mushroom soup and a microwaved bag of frozen mixed vegetables with butter and pepper. The Piroshki was filling--nobody ate more than one."
12657,9477,2001-08-07,4,"Like most apple and banana drinks, I loved this one too. Never realised how well bananas and apples go together! Had to make it without the vanilla extract though... had none left at home :("
23863,10446,2001-11-21,4,This recipie makes a colorful and festive salad with a great blend of oriental and fruit flavors. I blanched the snow peas to bring out the bright green color but still kept the crunchy texture.
16459,13440,2001-10-31,5,These are good! I used to have this recipe and I lost it.
26425,14184,2001-12-17,5,I lived in Korea when I was a member of the army. That's how I know about this dish. I've made the dish several times. I like to crack my egg raw into boiling Kalbi Tang. This seems to give more flavor to the dish. This dish is very easy to make.
23302,14260,2001-11-16,1,"Bottled Ranch Dressing is LOADED with sodium - so I am going to post a recipe called ""Italian Dressing - Low Sodium"" that you ought to try instead of store-bought dressing.

Also, how on earth do you squeeze TEN servings out of 2-3 CUPS OF PASTA????"
25358,14260,2001-12-04,5,"This recipe is great.  It is perfect for a picnic or potluck.  It is not meant to be a main dish. I had a Packer Party with 9 guys and it was all gone, but we had enough to go around.  I now make 4 cups of rotini noodles and a Large bottle of Ranch and it tastes great.  This recipe is a huge hit.  The guys wanted the recipe to give to their wives to make!"
20935,11574,2001-10-20,5,It is an Awesome dish!!! My  whole family LOVED it!!
18391,11574,2001-12-03,5,I used skinless boneless chicken breasts. It was so good!!!
14464,3730,2001-08-15,4,This is a very rich frosting!  It is delicious.  I added crushed pineapple after following the recipe and it was marvelous!!!! I got a lot of good compliments.
2695,12134,2001-01-19,5,This dish was excellent.  The sauce turned out wonderful and was an excellent choice for the pork chops !
13318,12134,2001-10-15,5,"Excellent taste, especially the onion sauce.  I will definitely make this receipe again."
6220,4420,2001-06-11,5,I switched olive oil for the butter(there's more than enough fat in the nuts I added!) and it was great--
10701,4420,2001-08-21,5,Realy loved this rice dish as I find it hard to get hubby to eat rice. He loved it. I used olive oil instead of butter also.
16282,4420,2001-08-23,4,I love butter but added almonds. Next time I'll try toasted almonds.  IH
13433,9814,2001-07-30,5,"Thanks for the post.  I was looking all over the net for my grandparents and I found your receipe.  Thank you, Thank you.

I think I'd reduce the oil and put in more cheese too."
10127,8654,2001-05-24,4,My husband is a really picky eater and he loved this very easy recipe!
19972,8654,2001-09-28,4,"This is great my men eat it up and ask for more.
The only hard part is keeping them out of the meat so you can get it shreaded it smells so good.

13593,8654,2001-10-28,5,"Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe.  It was very simple to prepare yet it yields delicious results.  My brother, who is a good cook had a taste and immediately requested this recipe too. Yummy!"
21399,8654,2001-12-05,0,I bet this would be fantastic if you add some BBQ sauce and serve it over buns or rolls for BBQ beef sandwiches.
9453,8654,2001-12-05,5,AWESOME!!!
21618,10932,2001-10-20,1,Not Impressive

16140,9186,2001-10-18,5,"Absolutely wonderful,the best brownie recipe I,ve ever tryed.Dissapeared as soon as they were made!"
13670,9186,2001-10-20,5,Very similar to Hershey's Best Brownies on Recipezaar website. Delicious.
21656,9186,2001-11-01,5,"This is a yummy brownie recipe!!
I've made it several times and it's always a hit.
Today was my daughter's class Halloween party and I brought these brownies. They were devoured. LOL"
20159,9186,2001-11-25,4,Wonderful homemade brownie recipe - won't have to worry about these getting old and stale.
20160,13490,2001-12-22,5,This is very good.  I didn't have fresh basil so I used dry and it was still very good.
20985,12541,2001-10-11,5,"This is a great winter warm up. Hearty, tasty and simple to prepare. Even better the second day!"
22291,12541,2001-10-28,0,"Great recipe. I use Black & Tan beer which is very bitter, but rounded out the sweetness of the katchup and tomatoe paste quite nicely.  I also added about a tablespoon of crushed red pepper flakes."
21752,12541,2001-11-05,4,"Great recipe.  I used a local black malt beer which is non-alchoholic.  I also threw everything into a roasting bag, tied a knot in it and tossed it into the crock pot.  Hours later we had a wonderful dinner with very little clean-up."
21694,12541,2001-11-06,4,"Pretty great, but I didn't include the ketchup in mine."
15722,8940,2001-08-21,3,this recipe is a good drink
16140,7517,2001-09-25,5,Just like my Granny use to make but she.d swop raisins for currants occasionally.
9869,7517,2001-11-19,5,"Been years since I made these, still taste the same, great!!"
25090,15017,2001-12-03,4,The flavors of this recipe are good and it is nice for your whole family to be able to eat french toast at once.  The recipe is very fat rich and caloric though.  Here are some tips for reducing it. Skip the cream cheese altogether (I did this by accident and it came out very well).  Use egg beaters or 3 whole eggs and 6 whites.  Cut the butter down to 1/3 cup.
21618,11091,2001-10-20,1,Not Impressive
4470,4367,2001-07-06,2,"I know that I did something wrong!  The flavor was there but it was too ""Gooey"".  Firstly I used fresh frenched beans instead of frozen.  I think this took away some of the added moisture that would thin the cheese/onion sauce.  I'll try again!"
23646,4367,2001-11-25,1,"Very disappointed.  mushy, not tasty.  frozen green beans were just lying there."
8000,9257,2001-07-17,5,Cool.  I would use extra virgin olive oil.  Also I would add a tsp of sesame seeds.
15338,9257,2001-08-21,4,"I have been making a similar dish for several years.  I use a small amount of butter/margarine
instead of olive oil.  I add the caraway seeds but not the sprouts."
12657,9257,2001-10-20,3,"It was pretty good except for the caraway, which I'm not a big fan of. I'd like to try this with sesame or mustard. Oh, and using fresh cabbage makes a world of a difference..."
12962,4022,2001-07-23,5,"The sauce is the winner in this.  I would make this for a dinner party as well, the portions are generous."
6512,11583,2001-10-08,4,Excellent easy side dish.
9044,4491,2001-05-03,5,"I had it for a club meeting, at my house. with friends and people raved about the punch. I do not usually like alcohol and I enjoyed it too.The best thing about it was, it so easy to prepare. I even had friends ask me for the recipe"
2312,11460,2001-11-18,5,"easy, and yummy.  I did without the stock powder without any problem and basted the chicken (2 skinless boneless breast) a couple of times while roasting."
18391,11460,2001-11-26,5,"very good, even though i didnt use stock powder .. no leftovers :)"
6357,16245,2001-12-27,3,"These cookies were something different. But, I'd like to make a few suggestions based on how I made them today.
Firstly, on mixing the dry ingredients with the butter-oil mixture, I didn't get a soft dough. What I got was something similar to ""boondis"" i.e., small round balls. I made these into round balls(just like we make ladoos) and then baked them for 24 minutes. Once these were cooled, I dipped them in the topping.
For the topping, I suggest to heat sugar and water together and once the sugar has melted, to add the honey. Allow to simmer for 2-3 minutes.
Then, dip the cooled cookies into this syrup and after removing from the syrup, arrange in a serving tray/dish and then sprinkle with nuts.
Initially, I made the topping as the recipe says, but the problem was that the whole thing hardened up within seconds and made it very difficult for me. That's why I came up with the idea mentioned above. 
Another thing, I could make only 1 dozen cookies and not 3 dozen as per the measurements mentioned in this recipe.
Overall, it was okie, something different from usual cookies."
16305,13685,2001-11-17,0,I've been looking for some good crock pot dishes and this one sounds like it is on the mark and will definitely be tried in my household. Really enjoying all the recipes the viewers are sending in. Happy Thanksgiving to all of you and keep up the good work!
21752,13685,2001-11-28,5,"I used 3 pounds of beef brisket, doubled the sweet potatoes and forgot about the fennel seeds.  12 of us sat down to Friday night dinner, could barely get up after stuffing our faces.  There were hardly any leftovers!"
10226,10048,2001-08-31,4,"I tried this and it was really good. I improvised, I didn't have bean sprouts, oyster sauce or ginger. I added mushrooms. Great recipe even if you don't have all the ingredients."
11811,42917,2001-07-09,4,This was delicious!
22015,7267,2001-12-07,5,This is a required recipe around my house.  The taste is out of this world.
12070,12830,2001-11-19,4,"quite tasty - depending on the size of the sweet potatoes, i'd increase the recommended number 1 per person."
17803,11095,2001-11-23,3,We enjoyed this salad.  I wonder how turkey pepperoni would taste?  Think I'll try it with the turkey next time.
21399,11095,2001-12-05,5,"I was going to post a recipe for this same salad but did a search first.  This one is so close to the one my family loves that I decided just to add the only three differences unstead of making a seperate post.  I add cubed cucumber and thinly sliced celery to mine and I don't use broccoli.  It is such a fresh tasting salad, and is the only pasta salad my daughter will eat."
6406,4799,2001-05-13,5,This is delicious and is very important to get the pineapple as dry as possible.  I used chopped walnuts instead of pecans.
13483,12578,2001-12-18,4,"4 stars becaucse this is so simple and versitile. I just added garlic (a must), used cheddar cheese and tabasco.  Quick, easy and good.  Next time I will replace one or both soups with tomato sauce, add more herbs and lots of Paramesan Cheese.  Thank you Virginia."
2555,4867,2001-11-01,0,"Sounds good...haven't made it yet.  Wouldn't this
be good on a pumpkin cake?"
12751,4715,2001-07-17,5,This recipe is as good as it is simple. I have been lookig for a recipe that tasted as good or at least close to my grandmothers Corn Casserole. I found this one to meet my expectations. It is quick and easy to make with the simplest of ingredients. Best yet my two girls ages 6 & & love this and they never liked corn before!
22626,3408,2001-11-01,5,"absolutely the BEST!!!
Quick to make, quicker to eat.  Ages 9 to 50 ate it as fast as they could get it in their bowls.
Terrific recipe!!!!!!!"
14295,10468,2001-08-23,5,"I have made german chocolate cake twice, and there is no better way to eat it than with the original frosting.  It tastes really good. I prefer it without pecans."
16878,3412,2001-08-29,5,mmmmmm
18399,3441,2001-12-10,5,"Tasty, quick,easy.  Great with crusty hot bread."
6357,14266,2001-11-26,5,"WOW Mirj! Excellent! 
I used 1 1/2 tsp. coffee powder and 4 tsp. sugar for 1 cup of yogurt.
Then, I followed it uptil the step of letting the frozen yoghurt sit out until slightly softened. After that, I took 4 bread slices. On one slice, I spread a layer of the yoghurt followed by a few Graham cracker crumbs and then a layer of the cocoa-golden syrup mixture. Then, I pressed this nicely so as to make a sandwich. Then, in the center of the bread slice that was on top, I put a little cocoa-golden syrup mixture in the center followed by some of the yoghurt on this circle in the center again and on top of this, I put a red glaze cherry. I stuck a little cute cracker crumb on this cherry. Likewise, I did with the other 2 bread slices. I've kept it in the freezer overnight, I'm sure it's going to vanish by the time I'm up:)"
16659,10198,2001-08-29,4,These were great!  I made then up on Sunday night and did everything except bake them the second time.  Came in from work Monday evening and popped them in the oven and served hot with some veggies--we didn't even need any meat!  I love quick easy meals like this.
6417,3760,2001-04-13,5,This is a refreshing fruit smoothie and I add some frozen cherrys and peaches...just to add more fruit and fiber....good stuff...
8940,3760,2001-05-01,5,"It was great, and easy to make I just loved it."
10781,3541,2001-06-07,4,"Not precisly what I had in mind about what Japanese Dumplings were, but I'm sure my friends will love them on long trips. ^_^ Animé on!"
15572,8490,2001-12-27,0,"I used sourdough, made it double decker, and added avocado.  Try toasting the bread too.  Terrificalness!"
13088,10361,2001-08-03,4,"This was the recipe I was looking for except the one I tried was sweeter. I added 3-4 tbl. of sugar, 1 tbl. of salt and 2 additional squirts of honey. It came out just right. This is especially good for the salsa eater that likes a touch of sweet in their salsa. My friends enjoyed it."
21694,9517,2001-10-30,5,"Had it for dinner, was very good."
12666,13257,2001-11-23,5,"I took this to work for a pot luck and every one loved it and wanted the recipe.  
My kids ate some and asked me to make more to have at home.  They usually won't eat new food, 
but they liked this.  Momma ate some and said she would like it better with sweet pickle
juice in it to sweeten it."
18771,3983,2001-11-20,5,"I made this for my husband and it was so good, it is going on the Thanksgiving table this year instead of the sweet potatoes. Thanks for the great recipe!!!"
16727,3495,2001-11-27,5,The lemon in this yam recipe adds a delicious change to the usual yam dish.  I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it.  This recipe has been requested from me from several people who dined with us.
10901,3493,2001-07-05,5,this was a great recipe.  Easy to make. I prepared it ahead of time and threw it in the frig. Cooked the next day and it was wonderful.  Great taste.  Would make this one again
13269,3493,2001-07-26,3,"This recipe is pretty good, but I like a heartier, more tomatoey lasagna."
2557,3493,2001-10-20,5,"This is a truly wonderful 'white sauce' recipe. I omitted the squash, added portabella mushrooms and used tomato/basil cheese. Served along side a meaty red sauced lasagna made the pot luck dinner a success. Everyone asked for the recipe, even the non-vegans."
24019,2329,2001-11-19,4,"Nice, wonder if change from beef to chicken"
11674,3508,2001-07-09,0,I have made a similar recipe for years (don;t include the onions and I also add dill weed.) I serve the tuna on a bed of salad greens for a great lunch or lite main course.
12318,2405,2001-07-09,2,"To me it tasted alot like watermelon lemonade to me.It was fun to make the rest of the family drank it,I went and bought a strawberry soda.
The Crazy Cajun
Ron"
13483,14123,2001-12-27,4,Excellent and easy.  I followed the recipe but I would imagine you could substitute almost any fruit for variety.  So easy and good. Thank you Erin.
17608,14123,2001-12-31,0,"I was watching a show on Food Tv the other day and one of the chefs did this recipe with blueberries, but first he cooked half the blueberries in a wine sauce, it looked really good, I'm going to try and track this one down and add it on..."
24296,3553,2001-11-23,5,good  and  fast.
8108,4313,2001-04-13,5,This is a Grat recipe. Every one will love it. It's not to dull but not to sweet either. I almost perfect. Except the preparation.
9869,52238,2001-11-27,4,"The cinnamon flavour in this dish is really nice, I found I needed to use more breadcrumbs and 1 more egg to do 6 pieces of chicken. =)"
22157,3517,2001-10-28,4,"It was a hit, I had to give out the recipe."
26022,3473,2001-12-13,4,"It took about 2 hours to cook down to the desired texture. If I tried to speed the process, the ingredients would begin to scorch (unless I stirred constantly). If I do it again, I'll use a crock pot. And I would do it again, adjusting time and sugar: the recipe is a bit too sweet for my taste, but has a nice flavor"
20371,2535,2001-11-09,3,"These squares are extremely sweet; they even overwhelmed a diehard sweet tooth like myself. I baked these up for a group of teenagers, and they did go over well with them. The frosting is very good; I can't wait to try it on a plain cake or, perhaps, banana. Do pour the frosting onto the brownies as soon as possible, as it starts to stiffen very quickly. If I bake this recipe again, I will reduce the sugar in the brownies down to 1 cup, and likely up the cocoa."
21752,9751,2001-11-14,5,"""Kids love these for a snack"" is an understatement! We added chocolate chips, peanuts and raisins to our and my kids were mobbed when they brought these to school!"
10649,825,2001-12-05,4,"Simple but, yummy. I added a bit of garlic to this when I cooked it."
1634,11250,2001-11-05,0,"I was playing around with  this sauce ( don't let anyone tell that you can't play with your food ) and found that when added to sour cream, it makes a nice chip dip or a thousand island style salad dressing."
15036,10890,2001-08-15,0,wouldnt be better to skin the tomatoes first so you dont have the skins in the nice end product
18391,12739,2001-12-27,5,"Very good, quick and so easy .. i loved it!!"
11295,3567,2001-11-19,4,The pecans are a very delicious additon to an old favorite
20754,3567,2001-11-25,5,I have been making pumpkin pie every Thanksgiving for years so for a change I tried this one and it was delicious.  So much lighter and tastier!  I guess I changed my traditional pumpkin pie to this one!
12721,5086,2001-07-16,4,"This was great!  Good flavor, easy to make and fast.  I added a bit of paprika to mine for color and a bit more flavor!!!"
26111,9831,2001-12-19,5,excellent and practical.  just what i needed
8653,6459,2001-04-24,5,but u need 2 have pictures
4470,8506,2001-08-01,4,"I took a few liberties with your recipe. I cut out the tomatoe juice, changed the stock from beef to chicken and increased the stock  to make up for cutting out the tomatoe juice and it was super.  Is'nt it amazing how many people are afraid to use 30 cloves of garlic?  It is the natural source of wellness!  Thanks!!!!"
10701,8506,2001-12-10,5,I changed recipe slightley. I added the can of tomatoes with its juce instead of fresh tomatoes. Have never used so much garlic but thought Id try the right amount. IT was fabulous even my hubby loved it so told him after eating how many cloves  He said I should reply to say how great it was. And many thanks.!!
20076,16283,2001-12-27,4,"I have made this for years.  It is a very quick meal for working mothers that have hungry kids to feed quickly.  I haven't made it in a long time because my kids are no longer at home, but in a pinch for time I might just make it again.  A salad and rolls are all that is needed to complete the meal."
4470,10665,2001-08-15,4,I used cashew nuts with Mahi-Mahi and it was very good.  Rich flavour
4470,10852,2001-08-15,5,"I used Artic Char and it was super, thanks"
25693,11579,2001-12-12,5,"This is a very easy reciepe to make. I made this for my husband and kids and they enjoyed it. This is a really good home cook meal all you need to add is biscuits. This recipe is great confort food :) 
I will making this again."
16140,9946,2001-09-21,5,I did't have Mustard oil so used canola. Very tasty.
23302,15066,2001-12-03,5,"Easy recipe to make, and absolutely delicious. But watch your timer - my bread was done a full ten minutes before I expected."
21694,13342,2001-10-28,4,Very good to serve with a meat oriented dinner.
5060,12365,2001-10-05,5,"This is good !! Love Alfredo but it is usually so heavy in calories. I put it over linguine and added some chopped black olives on top, also sprinkled some more parmesan on top. Used 2% milk, didn't have 1%. A very good supper,
thank-you Jellybean, it will be a repeat!!
Dorothy"
12657,12365,2001-11-26,5,"Absolutely marvellous! Like Dorothy, I've stayed away from Alfredo sauces because they're usually so heavy. I used this recipe as a side with a German Pasta dish, and it was great! The only problem I had was: Since I'd scaled it down to 1 serving (there's always a limit to how much you can scale a recipe!) and was probably too ""patient"" while cooking, the sauce turned out a bit too thick and I had to ""loosen"" it up a bit with some extra milk. But I'm definitely going to try this one again... it's a sure winner!"
8000,10808,2001-09-11,4,"Too much garlic for me.  
I would use some of the garlic and parsley in the boiling pasta."
1634,11530,2001-09-14,4,"Just to sweeten this up a bit, I mixed the yellow mustard half and half with honey. The oven temperature and timing still works well if only one chicken breast is baked."
9433,6518,2001-07-02,3,"I mmade the slaw with all of the ingredients and my husband would not eat it. I did not like it that much either. Then I omitted mustard, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and onions. My husband and I liked a lot better, however we both like my original cole slaw better.

Thanks for your wonderful recipe and cooking site. I give recipezaar 10 stars.

Nancy"
5979,5132,2001-02-22,5,"This recipie is EXCELLENT!!  I went out on a limb and made this biscotti for my new boyfriend for Velentine's day.  He is Italian, and so I figured by baking an Italian dessert, he would either love it, or tell me I was an awful cook!  Well, I split the recipe in half and by the end of the next day, he and his roommates had eaten ALL of it!  They loved it and I became known as a ""fabulous cook""!  Thank you so much for this delicious recipe - it really came through for me!
Anyone who is considering making this dessert - you should!  It is fantastic!"
23414,5132,2001-12-12,4,I have tried a lot of chocolate biscotti recipes and this one is the best.  Mae sure you realize that the white chocolate is for dipping the cooies - it should not be added to the dough.
7308,10140,2001-10-01,5,"I was apprehensive about trying these as I thought I'd be too used to deep-fried.  These were great!

Next time, I'm going to try adding a bit of cornmeal with the crumbs."
6302,4608,2001-03-07,5,First web site that had the recipe!!! Thanks You!!!!!
11871,4608,2001-07-02,5,it is a good meal for on the go people.
11927,4608,2001-07-05,4,"even though i made some modifications it was still
very yummy"
21627,4608,2001-11-29,4,"Very tasty, especially the sauce. It's easy to make and very filling."
21267,4608,2001-11-30,3,No way... this is NOT authentic at all. But this recipe is a good substitute for those who don't have the real ingredients nearby.
26541,4608,2001-12-18,5,YES!!! Okonomiyaki is the BEST!!!
21694,12548,2001-10-28,5,"Delicious, light, and simple."
6357,9002,2001-06-04,3,I liked the idea of letting the chicken cook in its own juices - very nice!
4669,2518,2001-01-16,4,"it can be made in 15 min., and i bake mine in 25 min."
4470,2533,2001-07-02,3,I cut the recipe in half and I should have left the 3 hot chilli's my marinade was nor hot enough.  Very moist tasty chicken.
5683,2543,2001-02-12,4,"Suggestion:  Subsitiution for bread crumbs. You can also use Cereal(corn-flakes), Crackers,and sometimes you can use Corn chips to."
13021,11358,2001-10-16,5,"This recipe turned out really tasty, but ""fantabulous"" is still not a word."
4546,6444,2001-06-12,4,"I used olive oil in this recipe because I believe it imparts a nice flavor
This is a good recipe and is easy to make. I served it with chicken drumsticks and a salad."
9876,70137,2001-05-25,5,Surprising hit with my family!! I tried green chilies since I had no olives & added a pinch of sugar with the chilie powder. Good for a change.. Surely a keeper!
19352,70137,2001-09-18,5,"Really tastey and filling.  I made this in two stages. First I made the meat mixture the night before and the corn meal topping the night I served it, then I put it together and put it in the oven.  I used chiles too and replaced 1/2 lb of beef with kidney beans.  I also saved the corn for the topping (I did drain it).  I like highly seasoned food and felt this was seasoned perfectly."
15368,70137,2001-10-15,5,This was a definate hit in our household.  Added 1/2 seeded and chopped Jalapeno pepper for a little extra zip.
20964,70137,2001-10-28,5,"Absolutely loved this! My husband loved it as well.  I put the leftovers through the blender, and my baby daughter loved it as well! Will definitely be making this again!"
21634,2571,2001-10-20,3,no whipped cream !!
23414,2571,2001-11-12,4,Tastes great! I used canned pumpkin.  It was very close to the pumkin soup I had in a Gourmet restaurant.  Try it!
9121,3722,2001-06-20,5,"As I am of Greek extraction, I know all too well that this CAN be categorized as Greek.  Tahini is very commonly used in Greek cuisine and can be used many ways.  Very good."
6357,3722,2001-09-04,4,Loved it!
6357,11251,2001-08-31,4,"Lovely, I love nuts n chocolate - u put me on the seventh heaven!"
15624,543,2001-08-21,0,6 points per serving
15385,12876,2001-11-13,4,What a change.....I like that recipe very much
3962,3900,2001-01-02,1,The recipe did not say to drain the juice from the pineapple and mandarin oranges and therefore it was very soupy!
9869,3900,2001-08-15,4,"Took this salad to a barbecue, I used the long 'thread' coconut and as I couldnt find a lemon yoghurt here in NZ, I used an orange and apricot flavoured one. It was really yummy...thanks  =)"
20064,12125,2001-10-28,5,I got called to work before the chicken was done. I returned home to find that every piece had been eaten. I was told the recipe was excellent.
16140,12125,2001-11-12,5,"Brilliant,My sons devoured them very very quickly!HAve made a batch of the mix and kept it in the fridge as I,ll be making these often."
18391,12125,2001-11-29,5,"Excellant!! I added some hot chili powder to it, with great results!!"
19799,12125,2001-12-28,5,Excellent recipe!!! After the chicken was done I used the leftover mix to make gravy.Chicken and gravy tasted awesome.My hubby was impressed.lol
4470,14089,2001-12-25,5,This recipe is exactly what I was looking for.  We had it last night in our Danish smorgaasbord.  Thanks for responding to my request for a recipe!   I used fresh garlic in the butter and can still taste it.. Cheers Bergy
9869,13982,2001-12-19,4,"Really nice flavour combination, I wrapped the salmon in foil and baked in the oven, very tender."
19913,52727,2001-09-26,5,easy tro fix and great way to get the kids to try sauerbraten for the first time.
22132,1024,2001-10-28,0,Sounds too complicated!
13670,13137,2001-10-24,5,Delicious recipe. Always looking for new ways to serve chicken. I used the turmeric (saffron not in my budget) and left out the anchovy fillets (personal taste). Served with pasta (instead of rice) and green salad. My family enjoyed it very much.
6512,5252,2001-10-15,4,"Easy,Simple,Tasty. Great side dish, but with a salad it would be a enjoyable main dish. Made 6 side dish servings."
21694,4096,2001-10-22,5,I loved these.
19966,4096,2001-11-28,5,I have tried almost every recipe for stuffed cabbage rolls that I have come across.  This is truly a great one.  Very different and I don't think the mustard and horseradish make it spicy at all so don't be afraid to try it. I served it with mashed potatos and garlic green beans.  Delish!
14386,4079,2001-10-16,3,"These were good.A good 'gingerbread' flavor.Next time I will bake them in a smaller pan,they were pretty thin.They were nice to pack in the kids' lunches"
18510,5298,2001-12-17,2,"Unfortunately, this dip just didn't do it for me.
I substituted nonfat plain yogurt for the sour cream, and I just didn't care for the combination of the yogurt's tartness with the chocolate flavor. Perhaps sour cream would have made a slight difference, (it's a little less tart), but I still would not have liked the tart flavor of the sour cream mixed with the chocolate."
14817,7098,2001-08-24,4,Very simple to make with not many ingredients needed.  The mustard and italian dressing made a nice dressing.  Tasty!
5060,13052,2001-11-13,0,"We had not had this for a while but we did last night and I just want to tell you, Try it, You'll like it!!!!  The Orange and Allspice with the liver make a great taste combination."
8321,6986,2001-04-18,5,"wonderful, very good!"
9622,7294,2001-05-20,0,I would love to make this recipe but there is no indication of how many eggs it calls for. HELP!
13819,10822,2001-08-21,1,"Use fresh boneless skinless breasts sliced and grilled or sauted then add the cooked chicken strips to the inside of Enchiladas with the cheese, then continue. Spice the raw chicken with cumin and or garlic, chili pepper before cooking!"
10263,11727,2001-09-18,4,this is a good cheap and easy to prepare recipe...thanks Eve
25653,16014,2001-12-25,0,"very, very good"
18660,7855,2001-10-24,4,The recipe creates an ample sweet and syrupy sauce.  If you like your sweet potatoes sweet then this is a good dish for you.  I served it with another recipe called Ham and Cheese Pockets. It would make a good accompaniment to a Holiday ham or turkey.
6164,12395,2001-12-05,0,"Actually, after one has mashed the roasted eggplant pulp, put the onions and other spices in the oil and fry till they are golden brown. Then add atleast a cup full of fresh and finely chopped tomatoes. Keep stirring till the gravy is well done and becomes red. Now add the mashed pulp and keep sauteeing for additional 3-4 minutes. Sprinkle fresh green coriander leaves. Only this way one gets an authentic indian Eggplant Bharta. Hope you find this useful.
Smiles
Mini"
12657,12395,2001-12-19,5,"Had this for dinner last night, and it was wonderful! The baingan (eggplant) bhartas that we get at restaurants are always terribly oily, but this one was very flavourful! I followed Mini's directions too... the tomatoes really added a lovely tang. Thanks! Also, I scaled it down to 2, but it serves 3 very generous portions if had along with rotis."
4272,4080,2001-01-02,1,It is like rubber.
10802,12253,2001-11-19,5,I DID eat all of it in one sitting!!
22278,12253,2001-12-13,5,I actually took your suggestion and had it with Jasmine rice.  It's pretty good and I love avocadoes.
6357,4112,2001-09-14,5,"Truly wonderful, feel like eating them all at one go:)"
15656,4151,2001-09-07,4,"These were real lemoney. Kinda too much for me but 
my kids and neighbor loved them. I give it a 4 star 
but Its a high 4 star :)"
7119,4199,2001-11-02,4,"Easy to make and also had a nice flavor, unlike other recipes this one actually had flavor. Very nice. Thank you for posting it."
16676,14520,2001-11-21,5,"to die for,,, the best ever.."
7802,11221,2001-09-04,4,These were a good change of pace from the usual tacos and burritos.
23179,11221,2001-11-26,0,"I can't wait to try this, I love Indian Tacos, I have made them before just throwing in ingrediants - the reason I am commenting is to tell you if you are in a hurry, you can fry some White Pita Bread and it tastes good also."
12069,8665,2001-07-12,5,Excellent meal that whips up in minutes!  I made it on a lunch hour.  You could add more vegetables if you desired to give it variety.
12392,8665,2001-07-13,4,this is good very close to my own recipe. i serve with crackling cornbread.
15501,8665,2001-08-21,1,Made this recipe and it was awful.
18128,8665,2001-09-04,4,"What do you do with the cooking oil? Saute the beef, which I did but it's not explained. could be awful
otherwise it's easy and good."
11989,8665,2001-09-26,5,"Everyone in my family and a couple of my neighbors tried and loved this beef stew.  I used dehydrated onion in place of the onion soup mix and soy sauce replaced the worchestershire.  I have never liked V8 Juice until I tried this recipe.  Just the right amount of veggie taste was added!!!

I procrastinated too long in the day and resorted to cooking on the stovetop which was about an hour and a half of simmering to tenderness."
10332,8665,2001-10-17,0,I can not believe this recipe made it to the top 10 list.  This was the worst beef stew I have ever had.  When I gave it a sample taste after work...I did not want to put it on the supper table!  It is awful!
27312,8665,2001-12-27,5,"Easy and quick to make on a stove top!  Just let it simmer til the veggies are done.  Great recipe for when there's not a lot of time to be messing around the kitchen.  The kids like my recipe for beef stew, but like this one better.  Get the beef stew chunks while they're on sale and it's inexpensive too!"
20713,12406,2001-10-07,5,"This was surprisingly elegant for such a simple recipe.  I was a bit worried about the vegetables getting dried out during cooking so I covered the pan during the first half hour.  The potatoes turned out just right - moist, tender and just a bit browned."
20497,12406,2001-12-13,5,My family absoultly loved this simpla dish. I made it with an low sodium Italian Dressing I found here on Recipezaar.. It was excellent. Although i did cut the Italian seasoning down due to the spices in the dressing. I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a freshing idea.
4105,7303,2001-01-29,4,I would rate this one a five-star if the hot pepper flakes were omitted. I would omit the hot pepper flakes and use 3 cans of tomatoes and add 1 can of tomato and green chile's. Also for the next time I prepare the recipe I will devein and shell the shrimp then sprinkle cajun spice mix and let the shrimp marinate in it. If anyone attempts this recipe and uses 1/4 cup of the hot pepper flakes you will probably not be able to eat it if you cannot handle hot and spicy food. Believe me I am an amateur Cajun Chef and I could eat the dish but most people could not handle it. I will make this dish because it is rather quick and it is a one dish meal. I will however change it as stated in the beginning of this comment/rating.
6013,7303,2001-02-22,5,"My comments are for those who just read the review by the previous reviewer, Bill de Bruler who commented on the fact that 1/4 cup of hot pepper flakes was too much for this recipe. I'd have to agree but also point out that the recipe called for 1/4 teaspoon, rather than 1/4 cup. This might explain why he thought it was a tad toasty. I made it with the pinch of pepper and loved it. Thanks"
6244,7303,2001-03-07,5,From the editor: when Bill made this there was an error in the recipe that incorrectly listed the measurement of the pepper flakes. I have corrected this. Thanks.
9061,7303,2001-05-04,4,"I took Bill's suggestion and sprinkled my shrimp with Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning Salt and let it sit while I prepared the rest of the dish.

I used Italian eggplant, and 3 cans of diced tomatoes with 1 can of tomato sauce, 2 Tablespoons of garlic.  I also modified the recipe to reduce the fat content.  Instead of using 2 tablespoons of oil to saute the eggplant, I sprayed a nonstick frying pan with Olive Oil PAM spray and was therefore able to tastefully reduce the fat content by more than 50% (sauteed the garlic in only 1 teaspoon of oil instead of 1 Tablespoon in nonstick frying pan as well).  Hooray for my waistline!"
17608,11087,2001-11-26,4,"My friend and I always go to Chinese bakeries when we travel and we always get ""Bean Muffins""  it was in honor of this that I attempted this recipe.  They didn't turn out quite right, which I will not blame on the recipe, but on the Sweet Bean Paste.  The dough is terrific."
9869,8505,2001-11-01,3,"Nice flavours, just a little bit sweet for me."
6357,14357,2001-11-16,5,"This cake is really yummy, I'd made it co-incidentally 3 days back:) Its quite similar to Chef Tebo's Easy dump cake and is really ""MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM""!!"
25933,14357,2001-12-11,5,"Wonderful! I however made a smaller version in a round pan using the ""Jiffy"" cake mix. Its just easier to have a plate for and there are no left overs (always keep wanting more you know)!"
9869,10958,2001-12-05,5,"Cheating? Who cares!!...it tastes good...lol
Didnt use the flour asked for, and it still tasted yum  =)"
8342,10958,2001-12-31,5,"My husband's favorite, just like his Mom makes!!!"
21694,13188,2001-10-28,5,"Very good, a must try."
21434,13188,2001-12-28,3,This was a very good dish....the rosemary and thyme made all the difference. This is a keeper.
27581,13188,2001-12-31,5,Thank you Dorothy for this crockpot recipe.....I only added a few things just to kick it up a little;>).....2 tsp ready to serve chopped garlic and 1 medium bay leaf also used Kosher salt....must say the best I have had!!!!
10216,4205,2001-10-23,5,I knew I'd got the idea for puting cream cheese in milk from somewhere...Makes a perfectly acceptable cheese sauce in a hurry...
9082,4225,2001-11-20,5,"This recipe is excellent, I make it almost every week"
6075,4176,2001-03-14,2,"This recipe didn't go over too well in my house. It makes a TON but my family thought it was too cheesy. Velveeta is a strong, sticky cheese anyways and when you use 2 lbs thats a lot. I think that if you added some spagetti sauce when you add the tomatoes it would help out a lot."
26689,11658,2001-12-25,5,Already made 2x this year to rave reviews. It's always a hit!
23394,5434,2001-11-20,4,"I like the proportions, but with a slight variation.  I cream the (softened) butter and sugar, then add the eggs, pumpkin, and milk.  Then the dry ingredients, doubling the cinnamon and adding a sprinkle of ginger as well.  Also, I have made the recipe as muffins, baking at 350 for approx. 20 minutes, to the great delight of my coworkers."
21752,11573,2001-11-12,5,"I didn't thing something so easy could be so good.  I added some hot pepper flakes and coarsely ground black pepper, and we were mopping this stuff up with pita bread after the chicken was finished."
15543,8402,2001-08-21,5,I tried this recipe yesterday for our American Legion picnic and it was a big hit. Everybody enjoyed it. I had some left over. It was very good. Thanks for having it on the site.
21694,4241,2001-10-22,4,"Very good, I will have to make it again around Christmas."
6357,11649,2001-09-16,5,"I loved it! Simple, easy and makes my heart and belly wanting for more:) You know, all these great recipes leave me wondering about how am I going to keep firm on my ground of not putting on those nasty kilograms:)!!"
1634,11649,2001-10-01,4,"I used long grain rice and let it simmer for only 15 minutes,in a pan with a tight cover, and then removed the still unopened pan from the heat, and let it sit for an additional 10 minutes.  In my opinion, the key to long grain rice that just tumbles on to the plate is making sure that every grain is coated with the oil."
21752,11649,2001-10-28,3,"I tried this the other night and it was good, although I cooked my rice using my idiot-proof microwave method instead.  My kids refused to touch it, though.  Their loss."
10216,13848,2001-11-19,5,"This I loved! just made it for lunch... unfortunatly my BF said it tasted ""strange""...I guess the combo of cilantro and tofy just didn't go down too well with him... he's more into steak and chips...shame, because I really enjoy experimenting with ""different"" things (diffferent to him that is, I love cilantro...and tofu). Refreshing and just a little bite from the cilantro and the onion. Nice textures from the rice and the tofu and just the right zing from the vineagrette"
2625,9241,2001-06-05,0,Just viewing the page reminds me how tasty it is!
2178,9241,2001-06-11,3,"Marinating in butter seems weird and not cooking the onions and garlic in the butter beforehand seems odd too. The salmon was good (of course), but I'm not sure the marinating added much to it."
10896,9241,2001-07-30,4,"I used this on fresh, fresh salmon from Seattle and my non-fish liking friends loved it."
11886,9555,2001-07-02,4,"this vegetable recipe is great, try adding some fresh rosemary sprinkled on the top, and it brings out a wonderful flavour. Yum"
14613,9555,2001-08-15,4,"This was very good, and the rosemary was a great touch."
10314,8698,2001-07-10,5,tasted great w/ lots of flavor.  We both loved it and I will make it again soon.  I would give it a try.
18395,8698,2001-09-06,5,"easy to make, tasted supurb, reccomended to ANYBODY!!"
18768,8698,2001-09-10,4,My first time cooking with a Curry Recipe that I liked!
9590,8698,2001-12-28,5,This one has become a staple in the family.  Love this easy and quick curry recipe...
9580,4110,2001-12-23,4,I am of Italian decent and am always looking for a new twist on serving pasta.  This recipe was delish!  My mother snickered as the sour cream was passed but proceded to clean her plate!  I highly reccomend this recipe.  As for the cheeses I used a combination of Gouda and Cheddar with a good measure of Bleu cheese for fun and flavor!  Go for it!
21694,4040,2001-11-12,4,Very good and refreshing.
20497,3993,2001-11-30,5,I made this recipe for my family last night. And they told me it was the best Salmon they had ever tasted. So I'm letting everyone know.. Make this for your family and they might just volunteer to do the dishes. Mine did. Thanks Helen.
13758,3988,2001-08-21,5,I omitted the peppers and it was still excellent.
20999,3980,2001-10-22,4,"We tend to like things that are spicy, so this was a little bland.  If I make it again, I will definitely add some more spices to the filling, since it's one of those recipes that can be adjusted to your taste.  Great thing to do with squash, though, especially since it's so inexpensive now."
6123,4776,2001-02-28,5,great!
12868,10263,2001-07-19,5,quick and easy to make tastes very nice
16140,10263,2001-09-06,4,Simply Delicious!
13736,10263,2001-10-12,3,Easy to make. Recipe did stipulate what to do with cinnamon and extra flour. Taste was ok.
8631,8470,2001-11-08,4,This was very tasty.  My husband inhaled it within 2 days.
13483,11853,2001-09-28,4,"Who thought up avo, banana, pineapple and cabbage?  And it works!!!  I let this ""marinade"" for a few hours and it turned out to be very tasty.  Will do this again.  Thanks for the recipe"
9869,14752,2001-12-25,5,"This was one of the appetisers we had for our Christmas dinner.
Very simple to make and very tasty, I didn't use as much cayenne pepper as the recipe called for, probably on 1/4 - 1/2 a tsp actually, but it still had a bite to it and everyone loved it."
15572,9495,2001-09-17,4,Very good light dinner with a green salad or cole slaw.
17721,9495,2001-10-05,5,"I changed the recipe and used 2 biscuits for
1 sandwich. I had a top and a bottom.Easier to
seal and you could fill it a little more.I then
ended up with 4 sandwichs. They were very good
and will have them again. They would be great
to have ready when friends come over."
21980,9223,2001-10-24,5,"Who would have thought eggplant & chicken together?    Very tasty meal, easy to make.   I added a little garlic to the browning of the chicken.    The  olive oil & white wine sauce gives it a fantastic taste."
26413,12762,2001-12-16,5,great recipie. simple but excellent
18660,3937,2001-09-18,5,This is the shrimp cocktail recipe I have been searching for. Thanks. It made a wonderful appetizer.
13429,8713,2001-07-30,0,"I make this same relish and I add 12 apples to mine...try it this way, its goood...."
6037,8534,2001-03-04,0,"I have not tried this recipe.  It sounds wonderful, but oh so high in caloried and fat!  Are you using whole milk ricotta?  And, can't a low-calorie marjorine be substituted but the butter??"
6358,8534,2001-03-12,5,"I just made this using nonfat ricotta cheese and light butter.  I also used Pam Olive oil spray instead of butter to ""butter"" the pan.  It was delicious and, I'm sure, considerably lower in calories and fat. Very easy to make as well."
8627,8534,2001-05-20,5,This dish is excellant!
10896,8534,2001-06-11,5,It is a guilty pleasure but I like to live it up everyonce in a awhile
12709,8534,2001-07-16,5,very good and my kids loved it!!!
12812,8534,2001-07-23,5,"EXCELLENT, MY HUSBAND AND TWIN DAUGHTER''S GET FRESH ASPARAGUS BY THE POUND''S IN THE EARLY SPRING BY JUST WALKING ALONG COUNRTY ROAD''S..IT''S OUT THERE AND WE LOVE IT. I AM ALWAY''S LOOKING FOR NEW WAY''S TO PREPARE IT.. THIS IS VERY GOOD. IF YOU LOVE ASPARAGUS, YOU''LL LOVE THIS RECIPE....."
19241,8534,2001-09-16,5,"This dish is excellent. I have made it twice now and the second time I didn't have any ricotta cheese, so I used cottage cheese which was also good."
10314,8534,2001-10-01,5,This was great!!!Probably the best recipe from this site. I will make it again soon.  Try it !!!!
18450,8534,2001-10-03,5,"I expanded the recipe a little to feed a larger group and put sauteed chicken breast as the bottom layer. It could have used a tiny bit of chicken stock in the expanded recipe, but was an absolute success. Very well recived - thank you!"
18391,8534,2001-10-06,5,"My husband loved it, thanks!!"
21694,8534,2001-10-28,5,This is a great easy recipe.

5012,780,2001-01-16,4,Very good but not a 5 star
6199,3928,2001-03-02,1,"Something is missing.  Followed to recipe and it was too runny and tasteless.   Tried to dress it up, but was unable to find that great Pappadeaux flavor.  Help..."
19345,3846,2001-10-03,5,"Wow!! I have tried to make white gravy a few times, but could never get it right. Now, I finally did!! Thankyou so much! :-)"
20828,3846,2001-12-14,4,"Good stuff!!  But I added a scant tsp of ground summer savory and 2-3 Tsp chopped onions to the pan 2-3 minutes before adding the flour to the pan.  Also, I taste the gravy and if it lacks flavor, I add a cube of chicken or beef boullion.  Really love GOOD gravy.

5503,3844,2001-02-01,0,Sounds a bit like Bigos
15814,6567,2001-08-30,1,Unclear as to what to do with the apples ect.
16140,10837,2001-09-25,4,Lovely fresh tasting sauce.
9869,13467,2001-11-19,5,"Used oil to brown the chicken, then butter instead of margarine for the honey mix, loved the flavour and the crunch.  =)"
9869,7806,2001-08-21,3,"Must admit, was a little concerned when I put this in the oven...but was actually quite nice."

7920,4330,2001-04-09,5,I have made this recipe several times.And my family just love it.It's easy and made a great dish for Thanksgiving.A lot of people have said for the recipes.My children also liked it.
10320,4330,2001-05-29,5,"I made the recipe for Memorial Day and my family absolutely loved it. I made a few enhancements too please my son,(topped with mini marshmellows, and sugar/cinnamon). It's absolutley a delightful alternative to our traditional candied yams. We really tip our hats off to the chef for this one!!!"
5988,4330,2001-06-04,5,We have had this casserole several times at our church functions and it always goes over big.
18424,4330,2001-10-04,4,It was wonderful and simple to prepare with items on hand.  Using canned sweet potaotes it was a snap to fix.
24388,4330,2001-11-21,5,was a hit at thanksgiving dinner at work and so east to make
26457,4330,2001-12-17,5,Really easy to make and delicious!  Don't skimp on the topping!  Thats what makes is special!
19799,4330,2001-12-29,4,This was good stuff.But next time I will leave out the nuts.
6563,4423,2001-03-29,4,"I LOVE this recipe!  My family always added sugar to make it a little sweeter, and my in-laws put crumbled Ritz crackers on top. Either way, this dish is always there when the family has a big dinner."
11811,4423,2001-07-05,5,"My 5 year old made this almost completely by herself and it turned out fantastic!!! Everyone loved it and because she made it herself, my veggie shy daughter ate 3 helpings!!"
15734,4355,2001-08-24,0,"I haven't yet tried this recipe,but a comment on all of the sausage recipes I've seen on Recipezaar. There are several which call for fennel,but none for anise. Try subing anise for fennel."
6357,10533,2001-08-01,3,Its a nice one except for the ladyfingers.
9121,10519,2001-08-23,0,I wonder what one could substitute for the honey to make this vegan. Maybe I'll use brown rice syrup and let you know how it turns out.
22397,8814,2001-10-30,4,"Liked this recipe.  Be sure to buy raw shrimp, not precooked as they will be overdone.  Would use a bit more chicken broth to ensure the sauce stock is ample.  Great job."
4470,4508,2001-06-25,4,Good recipe I'll certainly make this dish again Thanks
18318,4539,2001-09-06,0,"I baked this pie in a graham cracker pie crust and it browned nicely, but when served it was a mushy mess.  Don't know what I did wrong."
4891,7393,2001-01-16,5,"When I was a boy in the 1930s my brother and I would catch bull frogs and father would dispatch and prepare them, we also picked wild button and shaggy main mushrooms, cleaned all and fried in butter, served on toast and devoured."
4470,4544,2001-08-08,4,I do this same recipe without the baking powder.  Tony Chachere's more spice is super.
14325,4687,2001-09-23,5,any icecream that children can do is wonderful. and the pudding gives a good creamy taste.
9007,4667,2001-05-02,4,Verry Yummy! My 9 y/o had 7 pieces!
20160,4662,2001-12-23,4,These were good - I added some feta cheese and red pepper.  Yummy

5060,12493,2001-12-10,5,"Very good marinade!! I marinated flank steak overnight in it, stuffed it, and used the marinade poured over it to bake it, I added smashed garlic 3 cloves, a dash each of cayenne, corriander and cummin.  Thanks Eve for a good one!!"
27115,15240,2001-12-25,3,"To make this a 4 or 5 star recipe, replace the nutmeg witha tea to tablespoon (depending on preference) of mild english mustard.
The dish will obviously become more savoury and be an absolute delight to have as a side dish with any meat dish. Yummmmy !!"
18995,7849,2001-09-19,5,I really liked this! I used frozen diced and cooked chicken and it made the recipe really simple to make.
21434,4807,2001-12-28,5,"I used CHICKEN instead of turkey, and it was very, very, good.  The skin was evenly browned,the meat was juicy, tender and flavorful. I stuffed the cavity with fresh rosemary, thyme and onions."
4395,4829,2001-01-10,1,I believe there is a mistake in the amount of eggnog listed in this recipe...5 1/2 cups is too much and the batter overflows a 9x5
9121,4854,2001-05-17,1,Not very good.  Not much flavor.
15041,4854,2001-08-15,5,Wonderfully light texture.  Delicious
14059,10756,2001-09-10,4,A classic.
18660,12436,2001-10-29,5,This made a wonderful side dish. I used almonds instead of hazlenuts and the recipe was delicious. I served this with another Recipezaar recipe called Roasted Sticky Chicken. I plan on making this again!
5929,4903,2001-04-09,5,"This is terrific, I also added about 1 tsp. of poultry seasoning.
Family loves this."
15609,4903,2001-09-23,4,"Very Good.  Instead of the chicken broth though, I'd boil the turkey carcass for really rich turkey broth."
11295,14645,2001-11-21,5,"oh, I made this today...and it delicious!"
26301,14645,2001-12-16,5,"I have made this recipie twice and recieved praises both times. 
 I will make it a regular meal in my family!"

All my friends loved it!!!"
9869,9286,2001-08-15,5,"Made this with the lime juice and ginger..wrapped it in tin foil and let marinade for an hour or so, then put on the barbecue for 12 minutes, it was really delicious.  =)"
16140,11472,2001-09-25,4,"This was really good,as a variation I substituted blue cheese for the parmesan,also tasty."
19799,5016,2001-12-29,5,Totally yummy!!One of my family's favorite.This is much better than what you get in restaurants.Plenty of crab with really good flavor.We eat them with sweet and sour sauce.
14059,11478,2001-09-10,4,"Very good. Works with skin-on catfish fillets, too..."
23139,8813,2001-11-26,5,"This was Delicious! HOT & SPICY! A friend's family
has a secret cajun shrimp recipe and I always wanted
to be able to make my own. This recipe is actually better than theirs! :) It was very easy to make and the french bread was good dipped in the sauce around the shrimp and to soothe the burning mouth. I will use this recipe over and over im sure!"
10958,5090,2001-06-12,4,"I thoght it was good, but not great"
5607,4395,2001-02-04,0,This would be better with real bacon
5581,4395,2001-02-04,4,I havent tried this but it has everything in it that I like. Im going to try it tommorrow after I go shopping.
5751,4395,2001-02-12,5,"Kraft used to have this on the market. This recepie is just as good, if not better."
6660,4395,2001-08-23,4,This was every bit as good as Heluva Good prepared dip.
22015,4395,2001-11-09,4,I had a store bought version of this dip years ago and haven't been able to find it since.  I was so pleased to see this recipe.  I tried it tonight and the family loved it.  Thanks for submitting this recipe.
27603,4395,2001-12-31,5,My family has loved this recipes for years!
15945,5146,2001-08-29,4,"It is a very simple dish to make and produce incredible result. Execellent taste and colour.

I would like to add my two cents worth... for those with a bit of time... add fresh mushrooms, lots of onions, garlic and goes great with roast potatoes. Time with 4"" deep dish... 1 hour. Be liberal with the white wine.

great stuff"
12782,5146,2001-09-06,4,"This was absolutely wonderful!  I work full time and go to night school and this was a perfect meal for my husband, and still warm when I got home from class!  If you are making it in a crock pot, you need to double the recipe or it will cook faster. (unless you have a small crock pot)"
18453,5146,2001-09-07,5,"This is a wonderful recipe.  I used boneless chicken breasts cut in strips, served over egg noodles. The mixture of wine and sour cream gave it a savory taste.  AND easy to make, just threw it all in the crockpot!"
18651,5146,2001-09-10,1,creamy ingredients and spices need to be added toward the end of cooking time.
13483,5146,2001-11-15,4,I did this in a crock pot with one cut up chicken and extra breasts.  It cooked quite quickly and was delicious.  I found the sauce was too thin so I simply added some cornstarch mixed with water and soy sauce to thicken.  Loved all the sauce.
21618,11049,2001-10-20,1,Not Impressive
13593,13269,2001-11-12,5,This is a delicious recipe.  The roast is tasty and it makes wonderful gravy for mashed potatoes. Definately a keeper.  Thank you for sharing.
18551,13269,2001-11-20,4,"I made this recipe yesterday and it was very good.  However, I thought there was an excess amount of 'liquid' for making the gravy.  I think next time I would use only one-half the can of Pepsi.  Thanks for sharing!"
23029,13269,2001-12-03,5,This is a great recipe!  I have made it weekly since I discovered it.  Flavor is wonderful and works with a variety of pork cuts.  So easy to make in the crock pot.  Tastes wonderful with rice or potatoes.  SO EASY!
26372,13269,2001-12-19,4,"I was skeptical about this one but it turned out to be one of the juiciest pork roasts Ive ever made. Allot of flavor. The gravy was kind of sweet for me, I might only want to use 1/2 can of pepsi myself next time."
23581,10510,2001-11-13,5,This is a great appetizer. Easy to make and taste good
2312,13423,2001-11-12,5,"So I left the butter out (simply error, not some health thing), but it still turned out great.  I had to throw in some buttermilk because I ran out of regular and I think the tanginess actually improved the dish.  Thanks!"
9869,13423,2001-12-03,5,"Tasty potato dish, I didnt use quite as much milk because my 2 large potatoes didnt look quite large enough for that amount of milk..sure were yum though. =)"
27122,15684,2001-12-26,5,I wish I had some of this right now.
23639,14198,2001-11-14,5,"So simple, so easy, my family couldn't believe it started off with a boxed cake.  It was very moist.  I plan on baking this for our Thanksgiving and Christmas family get togethers.  Thanks Malinda for the great recipe."
5484,5203,2001-02-01,5,"After extensive research on turkey soup recipes, you were my first choice.  Now your turkey soup has become ""Deidre's famous turkey soup"".  I have a stomach condition that requires soup on a daily basis and having previously not liked soup, this was a difficult step for me.  But your recipe has converted me into a soup lover.  It works great for chicken too.  Thank you for adding spices, herbs and FLAVOUR to your recipe.  It really is different and great tasting.  Your efforts to get this out to people like me is very much appreciated.

Thanksgiving Dinner and It was great,everybody wants the recipe,so I am emailing it to them.
It is the nicest salad with a delightful crunch,and the corn gives it a very good taste,my husband has decided I will make this for him often-----VERY GOOD"
6357,5134,2001-09-16,5,"WONDERFUL! Lots of cutting involved but then worth the effort definitely! The best part is that it can be enjoyed in the days to come!

I did find however using store bought pie shells there is a little to much filling, that ended up on the bottom of my oven, even using a cookie sheet.  I am about to make another one with a friend. I am about to make another one with a friend.  Thanks again!"
5929,7954,2001-02-18,5,"I haven't made this as yet, today is Feb. 18,2001, but I boiled the carcass of a turkey and the ingredients you have listed just fit us to a tee.  I just happened on this site looking for a quick, easy, tasty soup.  I am rating it even though I haven't tasted it yet.  I can just tell by the ingredients. I would serve it with crusty bread and a nice light white wine.  Preferably Gallo's white Zinfandel.  Nice going!!"
20754,7954,2001-11-27,5,"I made this soup and it is awesome!  Came looking for a recipe to use up some of my leftover turkey and found this soup.  Well, I will be making it again.  I have plenty of turkey left!"
10216,13036,2001-10-22,5,"I'd just like to say that its not really corn flour, It's a special flour called ""Harina PAN"", made in venezuela and the canary islands. It's easy to find in any large chain supermarket, you can even buy it online.
I've really enjoyed theese since the first time my BF made them (I always fear my BF in the kitchen!)."

19895,4792,2001-09-26,5,Just plain yum
21694,11053,2001-11-14,3,These were only OK.  They tasted a little too sour.
12711,8438,2001-07-16,4,"Fast easy and delicious,, 1 tablespoon of ginger was plenty."
14613,8438,2001-08-21,5,Made the tofu delicious and creamy.  I used olive oil instead of sesame and peanut and it worked out just as well.
4340,8008,2001-01-05,0,"Concerning handling chili peppers, it really is unnecessary to use gloves.
What I have done for years is wash my hands with a small amount of liquid dishwashing detergent and water immediately after handling the peppers.  This technique has never failed to remove the capsaicin-bearing oil.  Regular hand soaps are not designed to remove oil and grease in the same manner as detergents and are definitely not as effective in this application."

11236,9370,2001-07-11,5,"quick and easy, great for the ""kids"" at Christmas or for birthday parties. I don""t know what chex are either but I substituted what I thought would be a New Zealand equivalent and  it worked.Audrey ,North Island n.z."

19799,9370,2001-09-28,5,I've been making this recipe for years also.I've yet to meet a person who could pass up a bowl of this treat.
20024,9370,2001-10-01,5,We sell this at our school as a fundraiser.  We call it Bulldog chow.
20327,9370,2001-11-22,5,Made this Thanksgiving day. Kids and adults all loved it. Just a tip... if you are going to double it (like I did) make two different batches. Easier that way in the long run and fewer chex get crushed in the mixing.
26886,9370,2001-12-22,5,"My 9 year old daughter has been begging me to make this for Christmas, what an easy recipie!!  This is the best stuff to snack on at home or even at the office."
8342,9370,2001-12-29,5,My kids loved this recipe. Great for snacking!
14059,10434,2001-09-07,5,"Simple and basic. I like it. It's an interesing thing to do for a party, and it scales up to 4 people easily. I did mine in a cast-iron skillet. It's a little easier to handle."
6563,4717,2001-03-19,5,I used canned sweet potatoes instead of 'real' ones. . .but it was still excellent!
18391,4643,2001-10-30,4,easy to make
5328,4545,2001-01-22,5,I used Cream of chicken instead of mushroom and it was wonderful !!! My whole family loved it !!
11009,4545,2001-06-21,5,This was easy and delicious!! I'll have to double this one next time I make it.
13483,4545,2001-12-27,5,I liked this because of its simplicity and taste.  The chicken was very moist and tender.  All I added was some cranberry sauce and it was like a mini Christmas dinner!!  Glad you shared this Rececca.
11285,5281,2001-06-18,5,"Easy to make, sweet, tangy, creamy, I added 1/2 a banana and an 1/2 ounce of coconut rum to give it a more fruity taste..Great drink!"
7329,5275,2001-03-29,0,havent made them yet but am very much looking forward to doing so...have missed the taste of faggots for 10 years....i just have one problem i have no idea what a pigs apron is....please if u could forward this info...i will look forward to trying the recipe.....thank u for being ther...
3634,5275,2001-04-03,0,"Yes, what is a ""pig's apron??? Are you referring to caul fat? <i>Editor's Note: Yes, ""pig's apron"" is an idiom for ""caul"", the fatty membrane that line's the abdominal cavity.  Also called fat net.</i>"
11733,5275,2001-06-25,0,having lived in Australia for 33years we often mentioned  english faggots we used to get before we left I was excited to find this recipe as I have often looked for it now I am dying to try it the only problem I might have is pigs liver is hard to get here but I shall keep looking I will let you Know how I turns out
15811,5275,2001-08-21,4,"The pig's apron is a problem. I assume it means a pig's caul which is a stomach lining and even the food trade is finding it hard to get this now. It requires the slaughter house to part with it, and in these days of BSE the ""dodgy"" bits of animals are not permitted by law to pass into the food industry chain. 

The only people who make faggots with caul wrapped around them are people who have access to the killing of the pigs.  So I don't know if an egg to ""bind"" or some other thing like the suet will cause them to stick together like sausages for easier cutting on the plate.  Without it many faggots just disintegrate and are not so good when that happens.   Rice paper might be a substitute but it's a shame you can't get a synthetic ""caul""."
5920,5275,2001-09-10,3,"I haven't yet tried making these faggots, but might it be an idea to pack them into sausage skins as the piggy bits are somewhat diffcult to get hold of?"
13711,5304,2001-08-05,5,This potato soup recipe is delicious.  My friends are always asking me to make this for them.  Its easy to make.  I add cheese and scallions just before serving it.
24064,13307,2001-11-20,5,"All I can say is AWESOME!
Great for friends and family because the recipe is so big. You can allways scale it down...But why whith Christmas on the way."
4200,13307,2001-01-02,5,"I received this ""hoax"" email forward about 4 years ago, but never attempted the recipe. A friend of the family made it for us just a few weeks ago and it tastes incredible! I can't believe I held on to this recipe for so long!!"
7230,13307,2001-03-29,5,"This recipe is awesome!  I tried it out of curiosity, brought the cookies to work, and everyone loved them.  They fought over who was going to eat the last one.  It makes about a million cookies, so unless you are sharing it with a large number of people, cut the recipe in half, or you will have more cookies than you know what to do with!"
7640,13307,2001-06-25,5,"If you add 2-3 tbs of espresso to this recipe, it is a yummy addition"
11065,13307,2001-07-13,4,"this is an awesome recipe except that it took me more that 6 minutes per sheet.. i put the cookies in for at least 15 minutes each.. and they were not burnt, nor were they undercooked.. 
it was a big hit with my family and coworkers.."
13628,13307,2001-08-15,5,"This recipe is excellent.  My cookies must have been much bigger than the recipe called for, because I only got 60 and I had to bake them for 10-12 minutes instead of six.  Still, fantastic cookie that I will make again."
8629,5315,2001-04-24,4,I brought this to an office holiday party and everyone enjoyed it.
15609,5459,2001-10-12,5,"This is FANTASTIC!!!  Instead of the oil, I fried a few strips of bacon that I cut up.  And, I also added a couple of ribs of celery.  For the whole k. corn I used white corn.  Very Good GAY!!!"
12615,5346,2001-12-03,5,"Finally, no left over turkey!!! This recipe was the best turkey I have ever tasted. I definietley will make this again."
9235,5378,2001-05-10,5,"This is great!
It isn't very hard to make and I did make a few adjustments and it tast very good whith homemade bread."
15022,5378,2001-08-15,5,"This is truly a great recipe - but it is right out of David Ruggerio's book. Thanks, David!"
9869,5174,2001-07-23,5,"Didn't know what sort of olives to use...so I used black olives...really tasty...thanks Bill.  =) I thought at the time it must mean green olives...I had none...and am a sucker for black ones anyway....didnt use many....will try it again with green....love this type of recipe.
"
1634,5174,2001-07-25,0,"This recipe comes from Marsha Adams, who hosted a program on American Public Broadcasting stations called Quilt Country. The first time I tried it, I knew it was worthy of lots of stars. I use those Spanish green olives that are stuffed with pimentos, because it adds some nice color.Since the recipe calls for diced, I save a little money by using the ones that come sliced in the jar because they are made from olives that are not perfect enough to be sold whole."
12545,5174,2001-08-06,5,"My kids loved this, even my daughter who doesn't care for tuna salad.  I substituted chopped celery for nuts.  Great to have on hand to make sandwiches for a quick lunch."
21034,5386,2001-10-23,4,"Very good recipe for silky white taffy. Does need to be cooked a little longer than indicated, however.  We cooked at hard ball stage."
8627,5392,2001-05-20,5,This is a very good veggie dish.  I went a little easy on the spinich though.
15385,10685,2001-09-10,5,very good..... a superb idea for lunch..
24155,14405,2001-11-20,5,"Anything Emeril makes is 5 star.   I may not care for the item, but that does not mean it
isn't 5 star."
25795,14405,2001-12-10,5,"The punch went over in a big way at our Christmas party,We should have made more. The wine was left almost untouched."
18862,11223,2001-09-11,5,"I had a party I was not sure what to make, so i made it,well that was the best thing I could have made,everyone wanted the recipe, I just did not add that much paste,and use garlic salt instate thanks"
13670,11223,2001-09-28,5,"Delicious and easy recipe. Instead of the hamburger, try some well-cooked sausage meat, drained. Add the cooked meat to the peppers and onions and proceed with the recipe.

Serve with some grated cheddar or mozzarella cheese on the side to put on top. And a dollop of sour cream too, if desired.

Serve with seasoned(olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika), oven-baked fried potatoes and a green salad.

I used submarine buns and/or soft kaiser rolls."
20480,5440,2001-10-19,4,I am so anxious to try this;I have been making a buche every Christmas for years & never really satisfied but this sounds like the perfect recipe.Thanks.
4470,5453,2001-09-23,5,"Excellent muffins.  I threw in a little coconut as well, about 1/2 cup"
11187,5472,2001-07-11,5,really wonderfull the recipe makes 12 muffins
2178,5478,2001-05-24,3,"pretty good, especially for how quick and easy it is."
11297,5478,2001-07-17,4,Easy and tasty.   Even easier clean-up by lining baking dish with tinfoil.    Great :)
16584,5478,2001-08-29,4,"I wish I had seen the comment about lining the baking pan with foil.  Clean-up is a bit of a challenge
but the dish is great.  Thanks."
12678,5483,2001-07-23,4,this dip is realy good and i suggest dipping your fav. fruits in this it is really good that way
5060,12211,2001-10-02,5,"This is the first time made and already is a favourite and will be repeated many times, with different types of cheese. Every one wants the recipe.
I had no ""hot english mustard"" so I added dry mustard powder to the mayo with a teaspoon of hot creamed horseradish, tasting as I went, until I got the heat I wanted. Also did not have any almonds around, so I used walnuts. I cut the sugar to 2 teaspoons,(for the diabetic).
Got rave reviews, Thank-you Bergy!!!
Dorothy"
16186,6528,2001-08-21,5,Wonderful and very easy to make. Some restaurants serve these with honey for dipping!!!  Yummy!
25784,6627,2001-12-23,5,"What a produce saver.  I was already baking and realized I had some bananas that were about to be tossed and stumbled on this recipe.  I used 2 very ripe bananas and 2 Red Delicious apples, shredded with peels on.  I also added 1/2 t salt, 3/4 t cinnamon(habit, i guess) and baked in 4 disposable mini loaf pans for 50 min.  Excellent.
Very moist and fragrant.  Combinations of fruit are endless.  Thanks for the posting."
27186,14484,2001-12-26,4,"This recipe made for a tastey bird. I ground up the melted butter and the herbs and injected it. It was good all the way thru. I also stuck some crushed garlic cloves under the skin, at the breast, hip, and legs. Thanks for the recipe."
6357,16006,2001-12-25,3,"Nice and easy to make. 
I added some walnuts, salt to taste, 2 tbsp lemon juice and 1/4 cup low-fat yogurt.
Delicious!"
21752,6715,2001-11-07,5,"This is a very good side dish to serve along corned beef or fried chicken.  The recipe calls for white cornmeal if possible, but I find that yellow cornmeal makes for an ""earthier"" cornbread."
7829,6761,2001-04-09,5,"This recipe is really easy to make. Taste great, like NewYork cheesecake, rich and creamy just the way my family likes it! It was a hit! Thanks for sharing."
18977,6754,2001-09-24,5,"I've found that freezing the beef until slightly firm permits slicing it into proper sized strips.
Seasoning I add while frying my ""Beef with Green Pepper"" is dark Sesame Oil (approximately 1-1/2 tsp), along with about 1/4 tsp. white pepper."
14386,6855,2001-09-26,4,"This is comfort food at it's best.My mother made this all the time when we were kids.I like it because it is cheap,I always have potatoes on hand.It is really goood with crumbled bacon in it too."
21487,6855,2001-11-20,4,"This is very tasty...my only additional comment would be that the ""time"" involved is not accurate. Between the slicing, boiling, mashing etc...5 minutes isn't correct. Good food either way however!"
21547,7031,2001-12-20,5,terrific!
6427,7027,2001-03-12,4,"It is great, fast a easy to make!"
9869,11266,2001-12-25,5,"Found this a little late to marinate the full 48 hours, it would have been more like 26.
I used it for a 4kg turkey and I'm telling you, it was the most tender turkey I've ever made, sure glad I found it.
Thanks Di.  =)"
11044,7066,2001-08-15,4,"This was pretty, simple, and delicious. I added some shredded parmesan cheese on top when I took it out of the oven."
18244,7066,2001-09-05,4,"This recipe is very good and the food is great! I like tomatoes, so I would add one more medium tomato.  I prefer softer zucchini, so I left the dish in the oven for 45 minutes."
19284,7120,2001-10-30,5,I am in Australia and don't even know what nutmeats are - so I did this recipe without the nutmeat/sugar topping and it is still great!  I was looking for egg and dairy free recipes and this one is easy to make and suitable for our allergies.
13483,13713,2001-12-27,4,Wow   a BLT without the bread!!  I did not bother with the corn so I don't know if it would have enhansed it or not.  The Avo was overcome with everything else so I don't think I'll add it the next time.  Glad you posted it Stephanie.
10216,14264,2001-11-18,5,Jalapeños...are those the small really really hot ones? if so Ouch!...if not...yum!
12129,8731,2001-07-05,5,"This was fabulous!  It was easy to make and had a beautiful presentation.  I put it in a classy serving bowl and saved some of the fresh basil to put on the top as garnish.  Kids loved it, and ate a ton!"
8631,7082,2001-07-19,3,"I didn't have any kiwis, so I used a large mango that was about to go bad.  It turned out quite nice, although my husband found that the lemon was over powering.  I would suggest maybe 3-3.5tbsp of the lemon juice instead of 5.  I also found that in the freeze above my fridge, the gelato did not harden until the next day.  Other wise very easy to make and tasty."
19830,7161,2001-09-25,1,"This recipe was seriously lacking something.  The ingredients were good, but the chili had no zip!  There was no bite whatsoever to it, just a bunch of different flavorings roaming around in the pot!  I didn't even realize I was eating chili until my husband asked me what it was!  What I did was I added some other ingredients to this sauce and saved the pot!  I was determined not to throw out my meat and ingredients!  

Sorry--- but thank you."
16184,7206,2001-08-21,4,I prefer to roast the bird chest-down for the first half of cooking time. This results in the breast being juicier and the back and lower parts not ending up mushy. Breast skin will still end up crisp and tasty.
6357,13621,2001-12-25,4,"Nice one, though I added some walnuts and salted peanuts and also some raisins as well to this."
5681,7240,2001-02-12,3,"the baking time of 1 hour at 300 degrees plus 
overbakes the cake and also chars it."
6313,7218,2001-03-12,5,"I tried this tonight and thought it waa excellent.I do not have a steamer,so I just cooked the asparagus in salted water for about 5 minutes, then drained it and put the vinaigrette on it.  It cooked so fast I was glad to serve it at room temperature."
6512,7218,2001-05-07,4,Easy and quick recipe. I substituted Sunflower Seeds for the Pine Nuts and it was very tasty.
20202,7218,2001-10-01,5,Excellent
4470,9418,2001-09-11,5,"Lovely recipe, my guests enjoyed it!  I used fresh orange juice and fresh ginger in the same amounts called for in your recipe  Thanks"
2312,9418,2001-10-15,5,easy and delicious.  I used 2 Tablespoons of julienned fresh ginger instead of dried and 6 carrots took more like 12 minutes to cook. Everyone loved it.
5088,9418,2001-12-15,4,great recipe! can be made with fresh ginger too.
4337,7435,2001-03-19,5,I tried Kevin's recipe for the Corned Beef and the recipe on the package of another pre-prepared brisket. The aroma and texture of Kevin's preparation were exciting. A fine blend of liquids and spices.
6990,7435,2001-03-24,5,"I had never cooked a corned beef before and wanted a recipe to serve family for St. Patrick's Day. Found this recipe via the Internet and tried it. Everyone at dinner raved about the tenderness of the meat and the flavor. They continue to talk about how good it was. The recipe was easy to follow and everything turned out perfect. In fact, they asked for the recipe."
7064,7435,2001-03-25,5,Wow!I came here looking for a recipe for corned beef because I had never cooked one before. I had to buy most of the spices but it was well worth it. The recipie was easy to follow and my 7 other guests raved about the flavor. They said they could have not gotten a better meal in a restaurant. Thanks!
7052,7435,2001-03-25,4,"this sounds Wonderful, i will have to make it.  however, why is it in low-cholesterol foods?
i don't think this will help out thouse how are not to be eating this.  hey, thanks for the recipe
i Have to make this one.
Mic"
5090,7435,2001-04-22,5,"This is without a doubt the best I've ever eaten. I served it to someone who said they don't usually like Corned beef, but she loved this recipe."
16006,7435,2001-08-21,0,"This recipe sounds delicious, and I'm definitely going to use it next time I make corned beef.  Just a thought---Mom was Boston-bred Irish and swore that whenever you cooked corned beef, you should always put it in plain water with a tablespoon of cider vinegar; bring to a boil and then discard the water.  Supposedly this cuts the grease that the meat gives off during the actual cooking.  Anybody else ever heard this?"
16346,7435,2001-08-23,0,"A suggestion to try: After cutting the fat off the meat (step 15), I often spread the meat with a mixture of equal parts honey and mustard and bake at 350 for about 15-20 minutes. It's an extra step but it puts a tasty glaze on the meat."
10649,7435,2001-12-06,3,What about the creamy white sauce. Corned beef needs this to be VERY YUMMY. check out my recipes I have a recipe for white sauce that I use on corned beef.
10216,9945,2001-10-22,4,"Nice, very tasty... I used my basil oil instead of vegetable oil... brings out the flavours even more, and mellows out the strong taste of the mayo. :)
Thanks very much for posting you'r pasta trick on the BB, I'll never cook pasta in any other way ever again :))) and have incluided it in one of my recipes (eventually credited to you, since I couldn't find your post... I've only just found it and posted a rectification to my recipe, so it should appear tomorrow.
Keep it up!"
20754,14562,2001-11-25,5,This Frappe is very good with alot of banana flavor!
24564,14127,2001-11-25,5,the perfect chocolate drink.  Love the taste.
17608,14218,2001-11-23,5,This was great!  It was one of my desserts on Thanksgiving and I got rave reviews.  The toasted nuts did it.
9926,14218,2001-11-26,4,"I think that this cheesecake was great. Very easy and fast to make. Next time, though,  I think I'll subsitute the apple filling for another kind, like cherry."
23267,13840,2001-11-13,5,A family friend used to make this when I was a kid and I loved it.  I've been serching for this recipe ever since.  It is one of the most delectable dessert recipes I've ever had.  The orginial dessert I had included tiny chocolate chips sprinkled on top.  Thank you for helping end my search for this fantastic dessert.
20076,13840,2001-11-26,5,My mother always made this for my family at Christmas and my sister makes this and uses other puddings as well.  I appreciate getting this as I wasn't sure hot it was put together.  Thanks
5060,12904,2001-10-22,5,"Love both oysters and mushrooms, these were wonderful, only thing I changed was the milk, only had 2%, I don't think it made much difference because I switched - used 3/4 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup 2%, it seemed to make up for the 2%, in any case, this was a great supper, Thanks for a great taste treat!! Dorothy"
25605,15229,2001-12-07,4,I thought that they were great and so did my family and my kids hardly ever eat sweets and well they ate these cookies right up
26478,15229,2001-12-17,5,This recipe is pretty easy to make and the cookies look very nice.  They taste even better.  Everyone I've shared them with has loved them.
2595,7803,2001-05-25,5,This has got to be wonderful. I'm a lemon lover and make my coleslaw dressing with lemon juice too. Will try this this weekend.
10826,7803,2001-06-11,0,I just bought a new ACME juicer with citrus attachment which will be great for making the juice for this recipe!
11044,9808,2001-07-16,4,Nicely spiced and moist. We liked the subtle lemon accent. I made one loaf and used the remaining dough to make 10 muffins.  I baked these for about 25 minutes.
13353,9808,2001-07-28,5,this zucchini bread is the best!
14915,9808,2001-08-23,5,I made this receipe last night.  It was very good.  Nice and moist.  Thanks for a great receipe.  Nancy
15645,9808,2001-09-04,4,Wonderful recipe; changed it around a bit & made muffins out of it; works superbly. Sprinkled the walnuts on top instead of in batter. Takes about 25-30 mins as muffins. Freeze very well as snacks. Makes 12 muffins. Bravo!
19219,9808,2001-09-16,4,"easy to make, moist, not heavy, cooks nicely (evenly, etc.) i gave it **** because i think the flavor needs a little zip.  nice bread for breaksfast or with a meal."
16171,9808,2001-09-21,5,Mary this was far the best zucchini bread that I and my whole family tried. They just loved it.I have given a few loafs to friends and they all want the recipe. Thank you for a great way to get rid of all the zucchini that I got growing in my garden.
19803,9808,2001-10-01,5,"Moist and very tasty.  I made only one loaf and we gobbled it up in record time. 

It was easy to make. Due to laziness (not wanting to run to the market), I substitued sweetened apple sauce for unsweetened and it was great."
14613,9808,2001-10-29,5,Very nice bread. I made it for a potluck and also heard more than once that it was 'the best zucchini bread' anyone's ever tasted.
4650,8461,2001-01-16,4,"I used olive oil instead of lard {I didnt have any in the house} and I only used 1 onion. I think it tuned out great. Thanks for the recipe, and I hope to hear from you soon."
19037,8461,2001-09-13,4,"This is a good basic recipe, but I like to add celery, green pepper, green beans, and grated fresh ginger root to mine.  The ginger root especially gives it a special touch.  A dash of Tobasco or cayenne pepper and some jalapeno chiles will give extra tang to it for those who like the hotter version.  I also like to add dumplings to it at the end at let them cook slowly in the gravy, which I thicken with corn starch.  A little burgundy wine, maybe one half cup also adds flavor.  I use olive oil in place of Lard.  Of course, use the ingredients you and your family like and in the quantities they like.  If some like it hot and some do not, omit the cayenne and tobasco and place these condiments on the table for each one to use as he or she sees fit to compliment the individual taste of all family members.  Mushrooms are good in this too and I prefer the stew itself to be at least half or more meat in ratio to the vegetables with plenty of gravy in it."
8797,8805,2001-04-27,3,"Aunt Su here, the variation on this is to add sliced black olives or sliced scallions to the top. Personally I prefer Monterey Jack/Colby cheese, or Sharp Cheddar on the top. But as Ann says any favorite will do"
5929,8805,2001-04-27,5,"This is a terrific dip, it came in time for me to make it for a pot luck supper at
my apartment complex."
22644,13167,2001-11-08,5,"This was a big hit in our house.  We did leave out the cilantro, we don't like it very much."
12657,13167,2001-12-16,5,"Had this in my brown bag for lunch today, and was absolutely out of this world!! The overnight refrigeration, crunch of the peanuts, and cilantro made this one awesome salad. You can also try this will walnuts or slivered almonds, and add some blanced corn kernels to make this a complete meal, accompanied with garlic bread."
2059,10584,2001-09-14,5,"Lindsey & I made these and served them with Honey Mustard & Ketchup -- the condiments are definitely worth it if you want to splurge.  Otherwise, plain ol' salt & pepper (and maybe garlic salt) work great."
4353,7438,2001-01-05,0,"Since 3 oz of anchovies contains 425 mg of sodium, I would guess that 2 anchovy fillets contain about 150 mg of sodium."
13656,7509,2001-08-02,4,During and shortly after the second world war my mother used to make this cawl with a sheep's head!!! That's all we could afford....I can still see the head soaking in salted water with grass still in it's teeth.!! However she made a wonderful cawl with it.
2178,9943,2001-08-21,4,this is pretty good.... i didn't have wax beans or green beans so i used great northern beans instead  and it was surprisingly sweet and nice.
6713,7548,2001-03-24,5,this is a great treat and easy to make!!!!!
13483,10722,2001-09-04,5,I like easy and good.  I bought the pie shell and used Cool Whip.  Came together real fast and looked great.  The out of town guests loved it.
7802,10722,2001-10-01,5,Extremely easy to make and takes almost no time. We should've made two; the first one didn't last long. Next time we will also try one with blueberry topping. Good recipe.
4470,12386,2001-10-28,5,"Really enjoyed this chicken!  I cut the Hoisin back to 3 Tbsp and added 2 Tbsp Black bean Sauce.  Easy and tasty Thanks Tebo, Cheers  Bergy"
1634,12713,2001-12-07,4,"Although I might argue about the balance between, onion and garlic ... the basic idea sounds great. Just rember that Cooking is a creative sport. The pasta should require about 8 minutes if thrown into rapidly boiling salted water"
5951,7568,2001-03-16,4,"Funny story .  . I went to buy the ingredients for these brownies, and I couldn't find mint chocolate chips anywhere.  So, I ended up using those York Peppermint Bites - you know, the little round ones.  I added a square of bakers chocolate so it wouldn't be overly minty.  Turned out pretty good, nice and moist; good texture."
6357,9972,2001-08-30,5,"Lovely and light, wonderful!"
20084,9972,2001-10-17,4,Yummy and light....better for lunch than dinner.
7995,8312,2001-04-09,4,I made this dish for my family and they loved it!  It makes a little more than 4 servings and is really filling.
14131,10795,2001-08-15,0,this is great!!!! my kids love it
19395,10115,2001-09-18,0,"I had a really tough time with this recipe. I only got 2 cups of juice and that was after letting it drip all night. I would love to make it but I wonder if the measurements are off. I ended up adding additional grape juice from another recipe, adding more sugar and a little liquid pectin and got a great grape jelly. Would love to try it again."
20954,9693,2001-10-11,4,"I added sliced mushrooms and diced red pepper to this recipe (I can't have barley without mushrooms!).

I also used fresh basil and added fresh oregano leaves.

Excellent! I'm staying away from MSG and was skeptical about this coming out well without vegetable broth but it is delicious... and even better the second day!

One change: I think I might add undrained canned tomatoes next time to give some more tomatoey-ness to it... the pound of fresh I used didn't seem to be quite enough."
27323,12316,2001-12-28,5,Mmmmmm.. wonderful! Hey Mark.. wanna come and cook for me!! :)
6357,14985,2001-12-10,5,"EXCELLENT! I enjoyed this tonight with my family. I just tossed in 1/2 a cup more of walnuts, rest I followed your recipe. It's delicious and really good. Thank you for sharing this."
4470,48296,2001-05-29,5,This is simple to make and really is tasty. I didn't have fresh coriander so used dried instead.  I'm sure it is even better with fresh
7802,48296,2001-09-04,4,We enjoyed this as a side dish with steaks. Easy to make.
9869,48296,2001-11-01,5,Try it again with fresh coriander Bergy..its delicious!! =)
6733,10171,2001-08-24,5,If like me you cannot stomach onions simply peel them and put them in whole. This gives the flavour without the texture
13593,9217,2001-11-22,4,This is a very good and easy to prepare recipe.  I enjoyed it a lot.  Thank you for sharing.
13483,9217,2001-12-10,4,"To me this was a pork stew rather than a Chinese Dinner.  It was good though.  I had to add garlic (I mean it just goes with any main dish) and some Chinese 5 spice powder to make it a bit more ""oriental"".  Good crockpot recipe."
21752,10255,2001-11-07,4,Where I live you can only buy bottled French dressing at specialty import stores.  What a pleasure to be able to have this on hand.  It doesn't keep for very long so I only make as much as a need (usually for my Cranberry/French Dressing Chicken).
20893,11487,2001-10-29,4,Add richness and flavor by adding 1 can of cream of mushroom soup to this recipe. This is a good recipe.
6357,8894,2001-05-24,0,YUMMMYYYY is the only word that can describe this yummy dessert!!
24995,16322,2001-12-28,0,This sounds really good and easy. Thanks. I'll try it for an appetizer on New Year's Day.
15609,11550,2001-09-19,5,These are just like my cousin makes (at last I don't have to BEG her to make them) Her MIL taught her to make them.
16140,12451,2001-10-09,4,"I did enjoy this.As I did,t have any Parsley at the time I substituted 1 tsp of Dried Tarragon to the chicken broth,it worked really well.I served it with steamed new potatoes and Asparagus.I,ll definately be making this again."
12657,7705,2001-07-17,4,"Very nice, light salad. Potatoes being one of my favourite vegetables, this made a really nice diet-y dinner. The potato water really adds flavour to the salad, blending really well with the onions.
You can also add a dash of nonfat yogurt, a sprinking of pepper and garnish with chopped corriander leaves. Adds a nice tang to the salad..."
6357,8996,2001-06-04,5,This cud b nothin less than the BEST!
5148,8457,2001-01-18,4,A fantastic version - very fragrant and complex taste.  Highly recommended for those who like spicy eggplant.
23139,15107,2001-12-26,5,This was very good. My husband really enjoyed it! I served this with wild rice and boiled red potatos. The extra sauce was delicious on both! I think this would be good made with chicken also...will be trying that next! Thanks!
23955,14325,2001-12-25,4,The smell when these are baking is incredible!
11368,10385,2001-07-27,5,Just made this and it is absolutely beautiful so easy to make - well worth trying
19816,10385,2001-09-25,5,"Hey everyone.
Im a young man from New Zealand and have been brought up on Lolly Cake. My advice is try it. Its so nice and so simple to make. 
Peace be with you all."
25992,10385,2001-12-12,5,I absolutley luuuurve lolly cake and was brought up on by my mum who used to eat it 24/7. She is so big now because she just couldn't stop herself so be careful. Happy eating :)
19799,10445,2001-10-12,5,Yummy
12657,8931,2001-07-23,5,"This has to be one of my favourite pasta recipes, simply because it's very simple, non-greasy, light, and absolutely yummy! I had to substitue the parmesan cheese with mozarella, but that didn't make much of a difference. One good variation is to substitute capsicum for olives. Use 1 capsicum for every 4 olives, and chop them finely. You might have to saute the tomato-capsicum mixutre a little while longer for the capsicum to cook, or you can saute it just enough for the nice crunchy feel :)"
26584,8931,2001-12-25,4,"Most fine.  I rinsed the green olives to get some of the salt out, and used a 14oz can of tomatoes:  it being that time of year.   This was the first time I have ever tried pecorino cheese, and it turns out to be made from sheep&#8217;s milk.  But, hey, Italian sheep.   My wife found pecorino to be too strong for her taste,  however, the rest of us loved it.  Next time I will have some parmesan out too.   A fast, easy to make pasta, worthy of a restaurant."
9690,8369,2001-06-01,4,almost like jamican patties
4399,7968,2001-01-08,4,"I found this recipe to be very good, but only gave it four stars as it called for (in my opinion) way too much celery and onions.  I cut the onions back to 1/2 cup and the celery to 1 cup.  I also added 1/3 cup grated carrots. My husband loved it!"
13483,12415,2001-10-22,5,Thank you Jessa for posting this recipe.  It is really terrific.  I was going to add some marmalade to it as well but did not have any so just followed your recipe. . . and it was great.  What a nice change from applesauce with pork!!!
6357,12608,2001-11-18,5,"This is ""WOW""!!"
7934,8113,2001-04-09,5,"My mother always made this recipe, but used a graham cracker crust on the bottom and graham cracker crust on top. She also used Baker's Dry Cottage Cheese. Thank you!!!!"
8000,7804,2001-12-07,5,"This is excellent.
I would add 1 tbs fresh, minced parsley, pinch of marjoram, pinch of cayenne pepper, dash of tobasco.
This is very, very good."
14059,7915,2001-09-10,4,"Simple, but good. I make something similar for my nephew. He likes to dunk his in salsa."
9869,12385,2001-10-28,5,"This was delicious Lennie, the flavour of the soup added was lovely.
I used fresh mushrooms, and served on hot buttered noodles."
10216,13451,2001-11-21,5,"Wow! the best thing since terry's chocolate oranges... just one problem...oranges where you are seem rather larger than oranges where I am... no way could I eek out 80 candies!!! 

Ok, so I'm making at least triple of this next time... this is *SO* worth the time involved... trust me, theese are going to be sent out as gifts to a lot of my friends. 

I used 99% chocolate for 1/4 of them, then added some 55% chocolate to that for another 1/4 and then added some cocoa butter for the other half, My friends have varied tastes...not all of them like dark dark dark like me! the 99% is so strong...bitter bitter bitter, but the sweet sweet oranges make it just scruptious! 

Thanks for this great recipe!"
17608,13451,2001-12-10,5,"Wow is right!  I love chocolate and orange and I always get coated peels at the candy store when I go, but I've never made them.  It was worth the effort and the time.  It took awhile longer on the cooking part than I think it should have, it took over 2 hours and I turned the heat up to medium halfway through because It hadn't even started to simmer yet.  I also just realized I forgot the lemon juice, not sure what that was for, hope it's not important because it still tastes good!  They will be gone in no time."
26979,13451,2001-12-23,4,"These are gorgeous -- and so yummy too.

The ONLY thing I would do different next time is to use superfine sugar rather than regular granulated sugar to coat the peels before dunking.

Yes, they are definitely a great gift idea, and really pretty easy -- my kids enjoyed watching (and tasting) the transformation from orange peel to candy."
16459,7940,2001-10-11,3,"They aren't bad, but I've made better. These tended to be more biscuity than others I've had. They were a little heavy. Most recipes I've used call for more sugar and use cream. I think that would help them. Also brushing melted butter over the top before you bake them is nice."
12118,8053,2001-07-26,4,a little too moist but excellent and I didnt care if they werent a perfect pocket burger.
14386,8075,2001-09-19,3,This was pretty good.The kids liked it and it is a quick dinner.
6512,8111,2001-08-05,4,"Easy and delicious recipe. I substituted ground  sausage for the ground beef, and added Monterey Jack cheese on the top for the last 5  min of cooking."
19319,8224,2001-10-15,5,"I''ve used this recipe a few times now, and I''m quite pleased with it. Although it is not complicated, the end result is wonderful.

Depending on my mood, and the availability of meat, I''ve used everything from fish to pork to chicken to beef to lamb as the "
5936,8430,2001-02-18,5,Easy to follow recipe.  Wonderful taste. Had no problems with cake or blueberrys sticking to pan.
13483,8430,2001-09-04,4,I made this and froze it.  I served it a week later and it was just fine.  Lemon and blueberries go together in this recipe very well
15609,9505,2001-10-12,5,"This is VERY GOOD!!!  I've made this two ways.  I made per the instructions AND, I sliced the meat, used the marinade and stir fried it.  OMG!!! This was soooo good. Served with fried rice. Mmm Mmm"
6164,37326,2001-08-06,4,"Too good an idea Laura !

Smiles
mini"
21752,13256,2001-11-01,4,"At first the recipe name intrigued me, but it was the ingredients that got me to try this out.  I used all beef instead of beef/pork, and left out the Worcestershire sauce.  Leftovers the next day made a pretty good sandwich!"
22040,13256,2001-11-18,4,This is a great recipe and the best combination to go into a meatloaf yet.  I always substitute jarred pasta sauce for the ketchup though!
8398,8678,2001-04-27,5,"I am adding this recipe to my cookbook, but using the natural ingredients, instead of the powdered eggs,  I viewed all the necessary ingredients and it looks like a top rated recipe to me.  Delighted to find it. I have not tried to fry up these donuts as yet., but I feel sure, they have to be delightful.  So I am sure they will be of a 5 star rateing."
6357,8678,2001-06-04,5,One word to describe this would be - LOVELY!!
9121,8678,2001-10-28,5,All I can say is - YOWZA!!!
10802,8678,2001-11-28,5,"These are very, very good."
25746,15839,2001-12-20,0,Please rate this recipe!  :o)
22311,13293,2001-10-28,5,"This is an incredible dish,easy,fast,i had time to cook and entertain.Everybody raved about it.I can't see eating salmon any other way now."
23016,10774,2001-11-06,2,"after  frying-put back in pan, steam squid in vingar--I like this cold or hot. The vingar  takes the fishy taste out, that is how my gandmother taught-they were from the island just off from Greece"
25720,12627,2001-12-10,5,they where quite good. they where almost as goood as my mothers mash potato scones she could not find the recipe so i try your thumbs up on the recipe will keep it on my computor so i can make them again
24129,8680,2001-11-20,5,Yumm!  Period cooking at its best!
19702,11387,2001-09-23,5,Awesome!!!  This is one f the best smooth salsa's I've ever had!
11297,8308,2001-08-07,5,My husband & I really enjoyed this dish.  I did leave out the thyme though as it is not a flavour that I like.   I also think that you could use chicken or beef schnitzel in place of the pork and it would be just as great.  I served it with a potato gratin and vegetables.    Thank you for this really easy tasty recipe. Cheers
14059,10766,2001-09-10,4,People tend to think baking and mayonaise don't go together. Mayo really does help the flavor and moisure of baked food. Really.
16658,12636,2001-12-18,4,I procrastinated on a class project and I needed a mexican dish QUICK!  This was such a fast and easy recipe and my class finished the whole thing.  I highly recommend this dip.
6357,8475,2001-06-05,5,"This is simply beautiful!
Thanks a zillion!"
4470,8456,2001-06-20,4,"I served this recipe with braised pork chops and it was very good.  Also, I added a tbsp of Madagasgan Green Pepper corns. Thanks for a welcome addition for my Veggie collection."
2525,8466,2001-09-10,0,This is absolutely GREAT.
7802,8479,2001-06-05,4,"We enjoyed this recipe, though I substituted coarse-ground beef (known as chili meat here in Texas) and added heat to my portions with jalapenos. It doesn't replace a good bowl of Texas Red chili (which like this recipe, has NO beans) , but it is a good change of pace. I recommend it."
15572,8479,2001-12-19,4,A dash or two of wine sharpens the flavor.
6664,9060,2001-07-05,4,"I have been looking for a Bulgogi recipe for years. I had one when I cam back from Korea, but the notebook with all my Korean resipes got lost somewhere along the way. This sounds exaactly like the recipe I used, except that the beef called for in mine was skirt steak, and we used no kiwi. Thanks."
14263,9060,2001-08-15,5,Excellent
19706,9060,2001-12-04,5,All I have to say is Mmmmmmmm.....  tastes just like my aunts!
13483,11150,2001-10-28,5,This rates a five star easily.  What a simple way to make a complicated truffle easy!!  Different toppings would go easily with this as well.  Next time I'll make the adult version with a bit of rum added to the pudding so it too can soak into the cake.  Thanks for this simple and delicious dessert.
9045,10219,2001-08-15,5,"Anu,

20628,10219,2001-11-16,1,nescafe?  This drink probably goes real well with a ding dong.
13729,8514,2001-08-05,0,I am entering snickerdoodle cookies in the county fair and needed to find the country of origin.  I wasn't sure if they were from Germany or Sweden.  Thank you for helping.  Hope I win the prize.
8306,8530,2001-10-28,5,"Easy to prepare, tasty was a real winner.  Will
use for my Thanksgiving dinner."
5951,8541,2001-03-16,3,"Pretty good overall; perhaps a bit spicy for my taste.  I was looking for something a bit more creamy. This recipe wasn't too difficult, and I ended up getting several meals out of it.  It's good over chicken flavored rice (like Rice-A-Roni) as well as plain."
6755,8541,2001-03-24,3,Adding cilantro and maybe a bit of cardamom and/or coriander would compliment.  Cooking time for crockpot wasn't clear.
7768,8541,2001-06-25,4,"This was a delicious recipe. I lightened it up a little by using only skinless chicken breast and fat free sour cream.  You could not tell that it was light as the spices filled in for the fat.
 Great recipe Josh."
1634,8542,2001-11-12,0,"This recipe works very well as an alternative dip for corn tortilla chips in place of sour cream based or cheese dips. For a quick off the shelf version, melt three tablespoons of raspberry jelly in the microwave for one minute, and add one tablespoon ( more of less depending on taste ) of jalapeno salsa."
4470,8555,2001-07-30,5,Very easy and great tasting. I used Gouda and it came out with a nice soft flavor.
6275,8554,2001-03-07,4,"This recipe was a sort of 'mock' lasagne.  I reduced the amount of tomato's by 8 oz because my husband is sensitive to them.  I added a can of olives, and some parmessan cheese. I added some shredded jack cheese in with the meat, onions, etc. Then I cooked the casserole for 20 minutes, then added slices of White American cheese on the top, and cooked it for an additional 10 minutes so the cheese could melt. All in all, it passed the 'family test'.  Thank you!  
                    Lea Evans"
12241,8554,2001-07-06,4,I tried the casserole with broccoli cheese soup.  I think it added to the recipe.
14532,8554,2001-08-15,4,I couldn't agree more; it has always been a favorite of my family.
10332,8554,2001-08-30,2,It was O.K.
15462,8554,2001-08-30,4,This dish was suprisingly and pleasantly alot more tastey then the finished dish appeared to be.  It was a great hit with the family - and with 3 boys (age range from 4 to 13) that is quite an accomplishment!!
14386,8554,2001-09-04,2,It was ok.The cheese soup didn't seem to add much flavor.I will try and different soup next time and stir cheese into the cassarol as well as on top.
12129,8554,2001-09-05,4,"My family loved it!  It isn't the most ""gourmet"" looking thing, but it was very yummy.  I might add a couple squirts of tabasco to give it a little kick.  Very good."
19377,8554,2001-09-18,3,"This definately feeds more than six.  It was very easy to make, the taste was okay, filling, you can easily add any other ingredients you like.  So overall it's a good recipe, you just need to add more ingredients to add more flavor."
15609,8554,2001-09-27,0,This was a disappointment.  We have always made a similar recipe but without the cheese soup.  With real cheese on top instead.
20776,8554,2001-10-15,3,"It was okay, not a lot of taste  - I may try the comments above, but it was good for a hot meal."
20964,8554,2001-10-16,4,"I thought this was lovely.  I used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed, which may have made the tomatoe flavour over powering.  My husband said it could use a little more pizazz, and suggested I put some Italian Seasoning in next time.  I''ll try it with Velveeta instead of cheese soup next time for a stronger flavour."
22394,8554,2001-10-29,5,Thanks for this recipe.  It has become a big favorite with my family.
17803,8554,2001-10-30,4,We thought this recipe was better then some of the other reviews that were given.  But I fixed it using 12 ozs of REAL CHEDDER CHEESE grated.
20159,8554,2001-11-19,4,"This was very good - although I did not use the entire amount of macaroni recommended.  Used Del Monte Italian Recipe stewed tomatos for flavor - turned out great with italian bread, salad.  Might use a bit more spice next time - but great overall."
23388,8554,2001-11-28,4,The Kids Liked It.  I cut down on the tomato chunks and used a little tomato sauce instead (because the kids would never eat tomatos).  I think that next time I will try using nacho cheese soup and some different cheeses.
16758,8559,2001-09-04,1,it is not that good its watery would not make again she must have forgot some thing in the ingredients
5355,8566,2001-02-01,0,I recommend this recipe because I've eaten these muffins many times.  These muffins taste great heated in the micro and then covered with natural applesauce.  A little cinnamon sugar on top makes it the perfect breakfast treat!
6836,8566,2001-03-24,4,"I made this recipe for my husband who was recently advised to go on a high-fiber diet.  I substituted skim milk (& soured it with 2 tbsp vinegar), and added about 1/3 c wheat germ to the recipe.  After filling the muffin papers, I sprinkled on some cinnamon sugar.  Being a fairly picky eater, I wasn't sure he'd like them -- but he did!!  I think the next time I make them I might add some cinnamon or nutmeg to the batter.  And I might swap some applesauce for some of the oil.  These are yummy!"
12600,8566,2001-07-16,5,"This recipe was great. My husband thought they were just great, and takes them for breakfast.
I added 1T. of cinnamon to the batter, 1/2 cup of coconut and 1/2 cup of wheat bran."
14059,10615,2001-09-07,5,Interesting and different. Very good recipe.
12777,10615,2001-10-06,0,used creme de menthe syrup instead of the regular creme de menthe. works just as well. wolfy
26396,15281,2001-12-16,0,Can also use taco seasoning dip mix with cream cheeze.
6836,8770,2001-05-14,0,"If you don't feel like making individual muffins, I found that this recipe can be made into a 9x3 loaf.  Just grease the loaf pan before adding the batter, sprinkle with some cinnamon sugar before baking, and bake at 350 for 50-60 minutes.  Let cool in pan on wire rack for about 10 minutes, then remove bread from pan & cool completely on wire rack."
23293,8581,2001-11-10,5,Just like my mother used to make wonderful.
9869,11630,2001-11-27,4,"These awful potatoes sure did taste awful, good that is!
I didn't use as much sour cream as called for, and used lite cream cheese. My son loved them, thanks for posting.  =)"
10505,11630,2001-11-27,5,I made these for Thanksgiving and they was a hit.If you are tired of making mashed potatoes and gravy these are great.
26314,11630,2001-12-18,5,This recipe was fabulous!  Thanks so much!  I am adding it to my top ten recipes.  My family raved about it!  Thanks for posting it!
18977,8570,2001-09-13,4,"The ""old country way"" is to use 2 crushed cloves of garlic for every pound of Boston Butt; also the use of the spice MARJORAM LEAF is essential (approximately 1-1/2 tablespoons per pound of pork)"
6357,8658,2001-05-24,0,"This recipe was published in the papers too!!!
So, what are u waiting for, try it, you'll love it too!!"
9690,8658,2001-10-02,4,My husband say's Thank-you!! He loved it.
14613,11644,2001-12-05,5,this makes a tasty appetizer.
14613,11293,2001-10-29,4,"Nice, easy, yummy and filling."
22015,14967,2001-12-26,5,"I made these for my Christmas buffet and loved them.  I used store bought tart shells and the apple juice instead of the alcohol, plus I used Sweet & Low's brown sugar and they were great.  Not too sweet, just sweet enough."
13063,15159,2001-12-05,0,"I just wanted to let you know that I had to make twice the amount of sauce to go with this- aside from adding another level of heaven to this dish, it went very well with ice cream!  Also, in addition to using the swirl bread, I tossed in a  few leftover pumpkin-spice muffins- YUM!"
21752,12247,2001-11-18,5,"I upped the mushrooms to a full pound, used vegetable stock instead of chicken and had a vegan's delight.  I served this with shell pasta, and all the adults at the table (4) loved it.  The 8 children turned their noses up at it, but what do they know... I think you have to be over 18 to really appreciate broccoli ;-)  Their loss, more for me!"
21618,10979,2001-10-20,1,Not Impressive
6164,10217,2001-07-16,4,Sounds good !
18954,10861,2001-09-13,4,"I made this without the raisins,it was excellent.
I served this with garlic bread,made with low fat parmesean cheese,sliced tomato's with mealted low fat parmasean cheese and turkey bacon bits."
6357,15273,2001-12-17,0,"This is truly delicious, one of my family favourites:)"
20371,13214,2001-11-20,5,"Fantastic! Not only are these both fast and easy to make, but the taste is terrific. Two comments: 1) I used a one-inch scoop and my yield was 40 rum balls; and 2) I'd recommend chilling the mixture for 15-30 mins before forming balls as it makes the process easier. Bergy, I'll be making these EVERY Xmas."
26788,13214,2001-12-21,5,"I just finished a double batch and they are wonderful. I'm sure after they set a couple days they will be even better. The refridgeration for 30 min. made forming the balls much easier. I used brandy, only because that is what I prefer. This recipe was fast, easy, and I definitely plan on making them again. I will be putting them out for X-mas before dinner."
18205,9272,2001-09-18,5,"This salsa is so fresh tasting and fantastic, anyone who has tried it loves it!!!"
3288,14393,2001-12-03,5,"I really liked this soup, particularly the next day after everything sunk in.  It became really thick and yummy!  Of course, we ended up putting the pasta in too soon so I don't know if that had something to do with it?"
6357,11644,2001-09-16,5,AWESOME!
6836,11644,2001-12-25,5,"This recipe combines two of my most favorite ingredients--mushrooms & spinach.  I used a box of frozen spinach (thawed & squeezed very dry), and it worked very well.  I sorted & cleaned the mushrooms, and made the stuffing the day before I planned to make them, which made the preparation on the day of my party very easy.  Everything turned out just fine.  These were soooo good at my Christmas party--my guests were lucky to get any!"
10486,8983,2001-06-01,0,"This is another ""Spanish"" recipe that you would be hard put to find in Spain. For one thing they don't use Cheddar cheese or Monterey Jack cheese in any Spanish dish, I doubt that you could even find Monterey Jack in Spain. They don't use sour cream either, in thirty years I have never been able to find it and always substitute yoghurt (in my non Spanish recipes of course)!"
22015,8983,2001-11-16,4,"THis may not be a true ""Spanish"" rice, but who cares, it tastes great.  We will definitely keep this recipe and sometime will probably add ground beef or chicken and turn it into a main dish casserole.  Thanks for posting, it's a nice change of pace."
22015,14943,2001-12-26,5,"I loved this one as did a couple of others in the group, but the other person who tried it didn't care for the seasoning.  I'd say, if you like the seasoning you'll love these so adjust the herbs to your taste."
6357,11439,2001-09-06,5,"W0W! Its nice, very filling, makes for a meal all by itself!"
2611,11439,2001-09-10,0,"Extremely disappointed in this, although it certainly must rate as an incredible ""retro"" recipe.  Not Chinese, not vaguely Asian - but does indeed use up cans of soup, and is no doubt a kid pleaser.  Especially if they have never been exposed to Chinese food."
5060,15798,2001-12-31,5,"This is excellant chicken soup!! I cut the garlic to 2 cloves because I only used 2 chicken breasts, and instead of noodles or rice, I laid whole green beans (canned) in the bowl and ladaled the soup over, cutting a few calories after Christmas, kind of turned it into chicken veggie, it made a great lunch, thanks for a good one Steve!! (next time We'll try the noodles)."
22407,44539,2001-12-25,2,"tastes very good, but doesn't make a nice firm cheesecake that I would be used to."
1634,8729,2001-07-05,2,"I realize that the object is to keep this simple, but I really think that adding some nutmeg would enhance the flavor."
7137,8753,2001-11-14,0,"This recipe is always a hit with our tailgate crowd.  I wrote the recipe for camping, as well as for backyard cooking."
7934,8744,2001-04-18,5,"Noreen Rak
This is a fantastic recipe and I plan on preparing this for company. Very healthy and appealing.  Thank you!!"
10426,9966,2001-11-26,0,Sorry about this one. It was bland and disgusting. I submitted these recipes before trying most of them to get the category up and running. Don't bother making this one. Laura Bruce
8584,8744,2001-04-22,0,Great recipe.  I have tried it several times.  The cheese step was an added item that realy adds tot he taste.  I know the author and he has a whole prtfolio of great recipe that are simple and delicious....stay tune for future offerings.
11591,8744,2001-06-25,0,"Ay, what's with this Newman's business?  Why not just use Heinz ketchup?  And a ""palmful of dehydrated veggie flakes will do?""  Heretic!"
21694,8744,2001-10-22,1,This is terrible.  Don't waste the pasta.
3682,8806,2001-04-27,4,"Wow! I have been looking for something like this. I really enjoyed it. I do have one question. How long will this stay fresh and viable in the frig? (Not that it hung around for long, we couldn't stop eating it."
7802,8806,2001-05-10,0,"I generally keep unused homemade hot sauce in the fridge up to 10 days, though I''m sure I have pushed it further a time or two. Use your own judgement, but my advice is to err on the conservative side."
10216,8806,2001-10-22,5,"Yummy... But what do you do with all that pepper-water... Must be usefull fo something (?!). as a substitute for ""smelling salts"" possibly :))) LOL
unfortunatly my BF hates hot peppers... he was not ammused ROFLOL."
13483,8808,2001-09-04,4,"The ""secret"" to this recipe, I believe, is saving some of the marinade for a sauce after the chicken is cooked.  Have done this twice and all who have had it enjoyed it."
4470,8808,2001-09-11,0,The only thing is you have to be careful saving marinade after the chicken has been in it.  Better to reserve some marinade before you put in the chicken. Hey I agree it's great to have some extra sauce Thanks for the comment
4470,8822,2001-11-29,5,I served this after a crockpot chicken dinner and they loved it!  I'll do this again.  How about using a pear?  Thanks Bergy
6357,14222,2001-11-14,0,"Hi!! Sounds nice, please do post the recipe for the Moka,
thanks!"
13483,13393,2001-11-06,4,This was a good and easy dish to do.  I was not too sure what biscuits you used.  I used a bought Pilsbury type.  I found it would have over cooked on top and under cooked on the bottom if I had not flipped them over half way through cooking.  Also added some leftover cranberry sauce.  Glad you shared the recipe.
21641,13393,2001-11-12,0,"Many thanks to Chef Tebo for the reminder on the biscuits. It depends on the brand and type of biscuits used, but I had forgotten that with some brands, you will need to flip them. I have had the correction made to the steps. Thanks again :)"
11674,10283,2001-07-27,0,"I used Bumble Bee Albacore solid white, packed in water. The total fat for 2 cans is 2g, and sat fat is 0g. I also use no fat milk there is 0 fat in this milk. Using these 2 products will lower the Nutritional Information by 2.84g total fat and approx 0.945g sat fat."
13483,10283,2001-10-15,5,"I am becoming a pasta fan with recipes like this one!!  This was excellent, simple and quick.  I, too, used skim milk but I added to the fat by replacing one can of tuna with a can of smoked oysters.  Hope everyone uses real parmesan cheese and not the cardboard stuff.  It makes a difference.  Thank for the recipe."
14386,10283,2001-11-12,3,"This was okay,but kind of bland.Nest time I make it,I will substitute imittation crab,and maybe some canned tiny shrimp,will use some Old Bay seasoning and garlic."
20964,10949,2001-10-17,5,"My husband LOVED this meal.  I usually don''t like burritos myself (strangely I prefer tacos), but this was really good.  If you don''t like re-fried beans, don''t worry, because while you can still taste them, the texture is 100 times better! Usually a meal in our house yields a couple of days of left-overs (I freeze everything), but this was gone in less than a day!"
20893,10949,2001-11-13,5,"I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used taco seasoned meat. Before serving, I layered it with fresh chopped onions and tomatoes, served with a side of sour cream. Easy and delicious.  Thanks,  Brenda"
20371,10949,2001-11-22,5,"What a fast, easy, yummy meal! DH and I will get two meals out of this ... excellent for just 1 lb of gr.beef. I'll be making this again; it was a big hit."
10896,9398,2001-06-18,4,My husband loved them!
2312,10074,2001-10-15,4,"from gay: interesting recipe.  i think i dried it out by cooking it too long, but it was still tasty.  really, a different combination of ingredients that work well together."
6357,8855,2001-05-24,0,Forget about those calories while you enjoy this dessert!!
9450,8927,2001-05-16,5,"This easy to make dish is not only delicious, but really nutritious as well. I love interplay between the spinach and potato - definately a winner."
10896,8927,2001-06-11,5,This dish is fabulous. we all loved it.
10678,8927,2001-07-18,5,I am really fond of this dish. It keeps well for leftovers - gets better even! Be careful on the amount of spices- I used too much cinnamon... Carol-  for dummies like me you should put some approx amounts..
21752,8927,2001-10-30,5,"I added some cumin to this and watched it zing!  Carol, as an almost-vegan I just want to thank you for your wonderful recipes!"
6789,8937,2001-07-25,5,Very tropical - A use for your aging bananas- slice and freeze then when you want to make a smoothie you add bananas as your cold base instead of ice.
17979,8937,2001-09-04,5,"I buy large containers of vanilla yogurt and add spoonsfull to this smoothie to make a fabulous breakfast drink.  In wintertime, I buy frozen fruit when I can't get fresh.  This drink has helped me lose 22 pounds (so far) because it is delicious, filling, and healthful!  And it helps me get in the servings of fruit needed each day for a balanced diet."
21752,8936,2001-11-06,5,This rice is superb!  The only thing missing was a little hot pepper.  Instead of topping the rice with the fresh vegetables I mixed it in to the hot rice and let the heat cook the veggies a bit.
15987,11518,2001-09-21,5,I absolutely like smoothies and this one has a twist--with vanilla ice cream and almonds in it surely makes me want some more!
23302,14953,2001-12-04,5,"This is easy, elegant and delicious. I am going to try the sauce on other veggies."
6357,11291,2001-09-04,4,Loved it!
21752,12564,2001-11-01,4,"I just tried this recipe this week, but I upped the cocoa to a full 1/4 cup and instead of water used soy milk for a richer flavor.  I am definitely going to make it again!"
9869,12784,2001-10-30,5,"The cinnamon flavour through this pudding is divine. Best rice pudding I've tasted actually.
=)"
18765,11129,2001-09-23,5,"This salad is absolutely delicious.  My husband didn't like it, however, because he doesn't like cilantro.  You could substitute parsley or leave it out entirely, if you wanted, but I like it the way it is.  I will make this often and am sharing it with my friends!"
21752,11129,2001-12-04,5,"This worked beautifully with a combination of canned black-eyed peas, chick peas and kidney beans!"
4535,51964,2001-06-06,4,"This was a wonderful change for potatoes, and very easy to make!"
6357,8964,2001-05-24,0,Its so nutritious and filling!!!
6357,8999,2001-06-04,5,"I liked it, yummy!"
25138,11510,2001-12-03,4,The Fire Balls are wonderful. What a great way to use up those green tomatoes at the end of the season.I will definately be making more of them next year & the recipe is being passed on to my friends who think they are wonderful too.GOOD JOB.
10711,9005,2001-06-06,5,"I tried this and this was really wonderful.
Raj"
6406,9005,2001-07-05,5,I have tried this with orange gelatin and mandarin slices.  The strawberry sounds great too.  So simple yet so wonderful.
11065,8999,2001-08-01,0,"i was very disappointed in this recipe.. i followed the instructions to the letter, & i found that the caramel was too dark & i only baked the coffee cake for about 30 minutes & it was burnt.. i would definitely not recommend this recipe to anyone.."
13674,8999,2001-08-03,5,I am not much of a baker but I did manage to get this one right and it was unbelievable!!! I would recommond that anyone try it. All you have to do is make sure you follow the directions.  Yummy!
9462,8999,2001-08-03,5,"very simple to make, my kids loved it!"
14183,8999,2001-08-10,5,This was delicious!  I had no problem making it.  It turned out perfect and my son loved it!
16252,8999,2001-08-23,5,"This was an excellent recipe!  The caramel did come out darker than I thought it would, but then I've never done this before.  I also cooked it in the oven for only 39 minutes.  If I had left it longer it would have burned.  Ovens do vary and the one hour time is approximate.  I think next time I may add cinnamon to the caramel or sprinkle it on top after cooking.  I took it to the ER where my mom works and the nurses LOVED it!  I will definitely make this again."
13301,8999,2001-10-20,2,"I didn't care for this. It was very plain and if I would have let it cook for 45 minutes in would have been burnt to a crisp. I let it cook for 25 minutes and it was almost burnt. I gave it two stars insted of one because it was easy. When I read this recipe, I thought that it was probably too good to be true, and it sure was."
11297,9014,2001-06-18,4,What a great quick & easy meal especially for mushroom lovers!
23718,9019,2001-11-15,0,Msrk your salsa has not been star rated because it is too hot I love hot food but mayority like hot not fire if you suggest the habanero could be substituted with (guero (wax yellow) or manzano (rarely found in US but looks like the habanero only it is more flavory and less hot.
10069,9051,2001-05-30,0,"The recipe states in the ingredients listing, 1 1/2 quarts of shellfish veloute.......it would have made it so much easier for the normal cook if a recipe for the veloute had been included. The everyday cook would not have a clue as to what shellfish veloute even is.  It's an elegant recipe, but worthless to most people, without the veloute recipe included."

6836,9058,2001-05-30,4,"I made this recipe for my sister-in-law, because she loves peaches.  I had my doubts about it, even as it was baking, but it came out great! I used canned peaches in lite syrup, and I added some vanilla & a little cinnamon to the batter.  Quick & easy to make, and tastes very good."
7802,9058,2001-07-05,5,"Here in Texas you probably can't drive more than 2 miles in any direction without hitting a barbeque joint. And if you happen to go into one that serves dessert, you will see peach cobbler on the menu. If I ever own one of these establishments, I will serve this cobbler recipe."
14112,9058,2001-08-15,5,"What a great recipe!  I love peach cobbler and I've always wanted to make it, but was scared to try.  This recipe is so easy and it turned out great.  Very, very good!"
7798,9058,2001-08-29,5,Great recipe!  I would like to put my feet under Joyce's table...!  Linda
6914,9058,2001-09-17,4,"This is a great recipe and very easy to make. 

I found that with fresh peaches I needed much more preparation time, and that it was ready
about 10 minutes ahead of schedule.

 Otherwise, this is a great recipe, and I plan to use it again!"
19318,9058,2001-09-18,4,"I made this for work...and everyone who tried really enjoyed it.

I did add cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter, and a little almond extract to the peaches!!!

And it was as easy to make as it promised."
1634,12077,2001-09-26,0,"For those of you who were as confused as Recipezaar's computer by the N.B. ... it stands for Nota Bene, which is Latin for Note Well. Although I am not a new cook, Turkey is not on my resume, but I found this procedure very easy to follow. Once I have tried it, I'll be back to rate it."
25656,12944,2001-12-08,5,"as a mum i dont think i would put in the double cream, but as a comfort food i can understand the need for fuel. it is the best mash there is."
22015,13835,2001-11-09,4,"Loved this.  I thickened the juices with some cornstarch though so that they would cling to the meat better.  This is a definite keeper. I served it on sandwich rolls with provolone cheese.  Next time I will add sliced tomatos, lettuce and thin slices of bermuda onion as well."
9240,14644,2001-11-25,5,"I have trouble eating early in the morning, but this recipe is wonderful because it is light enough to stomach at 7am and good for you, too.
Thanks, Sanut"
9121,14644,2001-12-14,3,I found this to be lacking in flavor somewhat. I will try again at some point and maybe add more seasoning.
18660,9109,2001-10-06,5,"I licked the bowl,the beaters, and the spoons. It was amazing that I had enough cream cheese filling for the actual recipe! I loved this recipe.  The phyllo dough made an elegant cup for the cream cheese filling and cherry pie filling.  I loved the hint of lemon in the cream cheese layer."
10486,9135,2001-06-01,0,I have lived in Spain for over thirty years now and I have never come across this dish...
21618,10902,2001-10-20,1,Not Impressive
18391,10191,2001-10-22,5,Very good
14188,10840,2001-09-04,5,"I prefer ""dry ribs"" not dripping with any sauce. Just tried this today on 2 slabs of ribs - cooked them slow and low (3 hours at about 250 degrees)  great flavor - sweet but sorta spicy. They don't NEED any sauce!"
25766,10840,2001-12-10,5,Works Great on chicken too!!
18391,11565,2001-11-20,5,this is a great recipe .. i used cooking spray instead of oil
25628,15350,2001-12-08,5,"Great Recipe! Creamy, filling and the kids liked it too!"
27329,14863,2001-12-28,0,"I make a similar recipe with cucumbers & sour cream.  Instead of plain salt,however, I use Garlic Salt (shake heavily), and also several good shakes of paprika.  This is a hit with everyone to whom I have served it."
6357,9378,2001-06-11,5,"WOW! Its perfect , made it ,loved it, ate it all!"
20895,13374,2001-12-15,0,"This is a fast, easy meal! Instead of Hamburgers or Sloppy Joe`s. You can add Velveta Hot if you like. Serve with your favorite sides."
27122,13374,2001-12-26,5,I can make this! And I have!
19043,11128,2001-09-20,5,"I added a bit more garlic, but this was a great dinner.  When I began braising, I thought it would be a thin gravy, but it really was beautiful.  Very tasty, very easy, very good."
16758,10985,2001-09-06,3,it is good we been making them for years we call them pa lard ski we use white flour fry them in a little oil i wanted to rate 3 1/2 but it is good
19905,10985,2001-09-27,1,This is a good idea but I do not like the potato idea but welldone anyway!!
6357,9196,2001-08-08,0,Lovely chicken!
18415,9272,2001-09-18,5,"I have been looking for a salsa that not only had a good consistancy, but also kept its flavor after being canned.  This recipe is it!  It truly is Wonderful Salsa!"
7802,9259,2001-10-02,4,This is a great way to make pork chops. The gravy is very good. The entire dish is easy to make and doesn't take much time. Great for after work dinner making. We served it over rice.
14583,9259,2001-11-05,4,"can you substitue dry onion mix for can french
onion soup?  can french onion soup hard to locate here in Memphis.... could mix dry powder and add only the amound that is shown in can.?  10.2 oz"
13388,9272,2001-08-06,4,Easy to make and tasted great.  Took it to a large family gathering for a camping weekend and it was a big hit.
14070,9272,2001-08-10,5,We loved this recipe. My husband and daughter ate 1 quart the first day.  We added 1/4 cup of cilantro to it.
14446,9272,2001-08-15,5,This is a terrific recipe.  Very easy to can and wonderfully DELICIOUS!!
14548,9272,2001-08-21,5,"I thought maybe with a whole cup of Jalapeno peppers it might be too hot for us, so I cut it down to just 2 finely chopped jalapenos and it is absolutely awesome!  Thanks for such a great recipe."
16254,9272,2001-08-23,5,I've tried alot of salsa recipes over the years and have always searched for just the right one. Well I have finaly found it!!! This recipe for wonderful salsa is the best!!! I also add 1/4 cup fresh chopped cilantro right at the end of cooking. Thanks for the great recipe!
16832,9272,2001-08-29,5,"Truly wonderful! Easy, great taste, and makes a large quantity although the salsa does disappear quickly."
17689,9272,2001-09-04,5,It really is wonderful.  I found that you can omit the sugar if you use Vidalia onions.  It is plenty sweet enough.
18464,9272,2001-09-07,5,This is an Excellent Salsa..  I've made 24 Quarts and all the neighbors love it  :)   Getting ready to make more.  Super Simple!
5888,9272,2001-09-07,5,This is absolutely the best Salsa recipe that I have ever used !
18666,9272,2001-09-10,5,just really good and spicy salsa
18947,9272,2001-09-13,5,My whole family loved this recipe! I didn't have fresh jalapeno's on hand so I used canned and cut it down to 1/4 cup on a couple batches for the kids it was still a touch spicy like a good mild salsa.
18973,9272,2001-09-13,5,I've never canned salsa before and this turned out great.  I cut back on the jalepano peppers and just love it.
10332,9272,2001-09-16,5,I have tried alot of salsa recipes and I gotta say this is the best one I have ever had.
6357,9290,2001-06-14,0,Mind blowing !!
18647,9272,2001-09-27,5,"This is an exceptional recipe for a canned salsa.  My only change was to lessen the sugar.  If your tomatoes are fairly sweet (home-grown, off the vine) you really don't need sugar.  My family isn't in to HOT, but we didn't find this recipe hot at all - even when made exactly as given.  Very mild, but with a little zip. ADDED NOTE:  After I drained all the juices off the vegetables, I canned that separately as vegetable broth for soups later.  it had a nice ""zippy"" flavor that will enhance winter soups."
20092,9272,2001-10-01,5,By far the best Salsa I have ever had! I even added some sliced black olives. Highly recommend this salsa! Canned great. Makes a wonderful gift too! They keep asking for more
20277,9272,2001-10-01,5,"I likewise have tried several other recipes for salsa and this is definitely the best one. I made my first batch exactly as the recipe stated and then made just a few changes to the next batch, cutting back on the sugar and using only the small can of tomato paste and it turned out wonderful.  I have several family and friends who love salsa and am planning on giving it as Christmas gifts this year."
20355,9272,2001-10-02,5,"This is an excellent recipe but our tastes are
for a slightly hotter salsa.  To the basic recipe
I added 1 to 3 hot peppers (habeneros or chili
peppers) increased the cumin 1/2 to 1 teaspoon 
and added cilantro."
20409,9272,2001-10-03,5,"This is the best.  I've made two batches and used Cherry Tomatoes from my garden.  For the second batch, I added one extra teaspoon of Cumin and a little more hot peppers to make it hotter, more like a Medium hot.  I also froze the salsa instead of canning it and used the Gladware containers.  I had read a warning from the Cooperative Extension not to can salsa because the vegetables in it make it unsafe to can.  I will make this salsa for years to come."
20966,9272,2001-10-11,5,This is the first time I have canned salsa and this one is AWESOME! I'm going to make another batch because everyone that tries it will want some.
16827,9272,2001-10-15,5,"This recipes had so many great reviews and I wanted to try to make salsa for the first time,I couldn't have picked a better one.  Was easy to make and tastes great.  Thank you for the recipe."
7093,9272,2001-10-20,5,Thank you so much for this recipe. I had been searching for the perfect salsa and this fills the bill! Linda C. from Kansas
22666,9272,2001-11-01,5,"I did 1 experimental batch of 6 small jars. I'm now down to 3 jars and this is such a hit with my family that I'm making another dozen jars as holiday gifts. It is truly wonderful salsa. My only complaint is the act of peeling tomatoes seems to ruin my finger nails. Oh well, it is a small price to pay for this good stuff."
19395,9272,2001-11-01,5,I have been looking for a salsa recipe to can and tried this one. I was a little skeptical with the tomato sauce and paste but it is great!! Canned beautifully and I won a blue ribbon at the Deerfield Fair with it. Thanks!!
23597,9272,2001-11-14,5,"awesome!  take seeds out of jalapenos to make it milder, leave them in to make it hotter."
20450,9272,2001-12-15,5,What great salsa! The best I have ever canned!
26597,9272,2001-12-19,5,It was very wonderful delight! I love hot salsa and this hit the spot! Thank you so very much for this recipe!
18649,9272,2001-12-29,5,We can salsa each year and usually use the same recipe each year.  This year we were looking to try something a little different and were very pleased with this recipe.  It has great flavor! The cumin adds some zest to it.  Thanks for sharing it!!
10366,9394,2001-06-14,0,"If you omit the nuts and spread with butter, powered sugar and fresh lemon juice.  My grandchildren love it this way.  You can add fresh fruit if you want."
19352,9394,2001-10-10,4,"This is a favorite recipe of mine, it is terrific!!"
18549,9394,2001-10-28,3,I've been looking for a recipe called the German pancake that they serve at Elmer's resturant.  This is the same thing!  Thanks
19722,9416,2001-09-24,5,We served this punch at our wedding and it was a complete hit!  I've since passed it on to 3 more brides!
18977,9464,2001-09-24,5,"""Pork Sticks"" can be made into ""City Chickens"" by cutting beef round steak into cubes and alternating them on the bamboo with the pork.
Very, very good...both hot from the oven or chilled."
16944,10875,2001-08-30,4,very good recipe
12875,9484,2001-09-19,4,"These were pretty good. My husband thought they might be a little too sweet, so next time I will probably put only 1 T of brn sugar.  But they disappeared very quickly even with the complaint of too sweet.  I served these on a toasted sesame seed bun with more onion and mustard and some baked onion rings.  They were good.  Will difinetly make them again."
20371,9484,2001-12-03,5,"This made for a satisfying, quick dinner that was very easy to make. DH and I found the balance of lemon juice and brown sugar to be tasty, but likely a little less sugar wouldn't harm the dish at all. I did not use the Accent as MSG makes me dizzy; I just sprinkled a little salt in the dish. I might add chili powder next time to jazz it up, but DH and I both enjoyed this as it was, served over toasted hamburger buns. Hardly any leftovers!"
20159,9491,2001-12-03,3,I have a simlar recipe and this is very good.  Nice as an side dish for potlucks.  Sometimes I substitute mexican corn and/or mexican monterey jack or colby cheese for more zip.
21694,9681,2001-10-28,5,"Wow, this was excellent and simple."
11199,9727,2001-07-30,4,"this is one beautiful tasting slice..so simple to make..was a big hit with my family..young and old .
Margaret.NZ"
11297,9492,2001-06-26,4,So easy and tasty.   To make the clean-up even easier I lined the baking pan with tinfoil. Thanks for sharing this recipe Kathy :)
14614,9531,2001-08-15,5,sounds very tasty
22278,9757,2001-12-23,5,Yummy.  I used soy cheese snd soy butter.
12517,9812,2001-07-12,4,"This was a great dish!
Easy to prepare, easy to locate ingredients, simple preparation and my four year old loved it! Who could ask for more?"
16489,9812,2001-09-16,5,easy and delicious!
17608,13379,2001-11-23,0,I have an alternate version of this that I whipped up last night.  I used a package of frozen rhubarb in place of the apples and a package of strawberries in place of the raspberries.  I also eliminated the lemon juice.  I guess this would be Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble.
11127,10331,2001-08-03,4,husbands duty machine bread maker and this white loaf is great
12657,12842,2001-11-01,4,"[editor's note: recipe was corrected as a result of this review] You haven't mentioned how much cauliflower to use! It doesn't figure anywhere in the ingredients! I had to make a rough estimate, and used around 1 cup of cauliflower florets for 2 servings. Also, the cauliflower seemed a little undercooked, so next time I'll probably half-cook them as well before frying. Otherwise, a very tasty recipe... the vast array of spices make all the difference!"
4177,9872,2001-07-05,5,"Just had it at a graduation party and everyone loved it.  It was done with Lime, Strawberry and Lemon.  It was cut into cube size pieces and got a ton of raves.  Delicious!!!!"
6357,9872,2001-07-05,5,Yup! All my little friends loved it more than words can ever express!
7802,9850,2001-12-19,5,Easy to put together and the end result is very rich. Next time I'm going to try it with an entire package of cream cheese (8 oz.) rather than the 2 oz. called for in the recipe.
17803,13382,2001-11-23,3,This salad was easy to prepare.  I believe I&#8217;ll use Pineapple Tidbits when preparing this the next time.
21791,9934,2001-11-06,3,"i would add more rum and creme de menthe next time as the pears seemed to really absorb it.   this really is easy to do and they come out great! i also tried this recipe using strawberries and peaches.  they came out just as good as the pears. i added more rum to the peaches and i didn't use creme de menthe for either one, i sued brandy with the rum for both instead."
16827,11562,2001-10-01,4,This was very easy to make and very good! It does make a big pot but beef stew is easy to freeze. I will definitely make again and keep in my recipe file.
8000,11562,2001-10-03,0,"I hope I'll never serve 15.
Sounds great.  I'm glad that somebody besides myself isn't afraid to use ketchup.  The vinegar, and spices.  Great stuff."
3734,11562,2001-11-22,1,"This one was a train wreck.
I cut the recipe in half and was glad not to waste more ingredients.
It had the worst flavor of ketchup.
No one in our large family would eat it and had to throw the entire thing away.
This was one of those recipes that we wonder how anyone could make this and think it's good."
15609,11562,2001-11-23,0,"I'm sorry yours turned out like it did.  I have personally made this for over 30 years and NEVER once has it tasted like Ketchup.  I don't know what you did wrong but I am truly sorry.  This is really very good.  Granted, it does make a lot.  Growing up in a large family you learn to cook for an army."
20075,10374,2001-10-28,5,Really good. Great to take for covered dish instead of one with mayo. Friends really liked this version and it is great to add tomatoes to it.
12657,10374,2001-12-11,4,"Very yummy, tangy slaw, but I made a few changes while scaling it down to 4. I used only 1/4 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons oil and even then there was a little too much of ""liquid"" at the bottom of the bowl. Next time I'll reduce the amount of vinegar, and possibly the sugar too."
5920,965,2001-09-10,5,"The amount made isn't enough, I made 4 times, it all went! Great!"
1634,9982,2001-09-16,4,"To make this soup just a little richer, I would use two cups of chicken stock instead of the water, and skip the bouillon cubes. Adding a little salt would make up for the loss of flavor."
11811,9988,2001-07-12,5,"Light, fluffy and cool! We put it in the freezer and it was wonderful! Very beautiful too.  Ever since I discovered this site I have been a hit on the ""potluck circuit""!"
12200,9998,2001-07-06,0,A great snack food or a main dish.  My kids just love this chili.
12200,10053,2001-07-09,0,What a great tasting salad.  Full of flavor. I make it a lot to take to family outings.
21638,10053,2001-10-20,5,This is one of the best potato salads I've made. I added crumbled bacon on top for garnish which gave it a little smoky flavor. I have been requested to bring this dish to another party - it was a hit the first time!
13670,10053,2001-10-28,5,Delicious. I used a large sweet onion instead of a cooking onion and added the crumbled bacon top (thanks to R.M. who gave me the idea). Everyone loved it. I'll make it again.
12200,9985,2001-07-06,0,A wonderful Brownie made from scratch.
11720,9985,2001-07-27,5,Delicious. Rich and moise. Easy to make
19629,9985,2001-09-23,5,Excellent brownie! I added a little more water to the frosting to get a creamier texture. My daughter loved them!
12258,10047,2001-07-10,0,Thanks Danielle!  I will give this a try.  It sounds delicous!! Have a TERRIFIC Week!
12734,10095,2001-07-17,5,"Almost as hot as the title claims, but with a rich flavor.  Made a big hit at a recent picnic.  This is a keeper."
9926,10095,2001-11-18,5,"The recipe wasn't hard to make, and the final product had a superb flavor. This chili is definitely not for sissies!"
25016,10095,2001-11-29,5,Man This chili is good.  Just won 1st place in taste and 1st place in the hottest. Never before has thie happen in our contest. Thank you

12200,10123,2001-07-11,0,So easy and so rich tasting cookie
18647,10123,2001-09-10,5,"My husband is an avid oatmeal cookie fan.  I have tried many recipes over the past 40 years of marriage and although he ate most of them - he commented highly on this one.  It is very good.  I made a double batch and instead of adding 2 pkgs of vanilla instant pudding, I used one vanilla and one butterscotch.  It gave it more of a maple flavoring.  VERY GOOD!"
23913,10123,2001-12-31,5,Very good recipe this is the first time I have ever made oatmeal rasin cookies and everyone loved them they continued to stay soft and chewy my sister loves oatmeal rasin cookies and she said this was the best that she ever tasted.....thanks
19043,11285,2001-09-26,5,This really was delicios and different.  We had never eated rudabagas before and they definately added to the recipe.  Thanks so much.  I did have to increase the oven time to 25 minutes.
13483,10225,2001-09-04,4,Microwaving the potatoes made this recipe come together very quickly.  It is so easy to do I know I''ll be coming back to it often.  Thanks for sharing it.

21694,10221,2001-11-03,5,This was really good.  Everything was equaled out with everything else.  Well done!
23866,16022,2001-12-22,5,This was great I was very suprised by the taste. I know my family will be asking me to make this recipe often.
11466,10316,2001-07-25,0,"Dear Claire: Thanks for the cake recipe using the egg yolks up. I haven't made it yet but plan to this week as I have company coming for the weekend including some teenage grandsons. Chocolate cake is always a hit with them.

19043,10343,2001-11-28,4,This was really very good.  My husband loved it.  I used a spicy smoked sausage and stone ground mustard.  It was very easy to prepare.  Thanks for a great Tuesday night dinner.
10290,10443,2001-08-05,5,"Diana,  These sound absolutely wonderful and I am going to try these next Monday.  I love hoisin sauce and sesame oil and I am just so excited - can't wait. Will let you know how they are!!  (It's a shame to get this excited about food!!!)"

14880,11124,2001-11-06,4,"Very warming soup, with nicely blended flavors.  I wouldn't change anything about the recipe.  Also try ""spicy squash soup."""
25933,14170,2001-12-11,5,I adore garlic (can never have too much)!. To simplify (and since I always have it on hand) I used two teaspoons of already miced garlic and a sprinkling of oregano.
22799,13568,2001-11-05,5,This was a delicious blend of meat and spices. It had just enough spice so that it did not overpower all of the other ingredients. Fabulous.
23925,11375,2001-12-25,5,Very good and Very nice I like it
12657,12668,2001-11-12,5,"I love the natural flavour and crispness of broccoli when you cook it just right, and this recipe brought it out wonderfully! Fantastic recipe, simple, lemony and something I just can't have enough of! I would probably add some more lemon juice to it too, because I like it real tangy. Thank you, Bergy!"
20075,11214,2001-10-24,5,This is so good and just as yummy if you use strawberries instead of the raspberries. East to do and so pretty on the plate.
19702,11386,2001-10-02,5,I made these for my girlfriend and she absolutely loved them ;)
15368,11386,2001-10-03,5,Just finished licking my fingers - Oh so good.
23715,11386,2001-11-15,5,"absolutely my favorite dinner in the whole world ever since i could remember. when the bbq pot ribs are cooking, they smell sooooo good and they are exceptionally tender and flavorful. i'd reccommend this to anyone."
20754,14345,2001-11-23,5,"This recipe is easy, quick, and delicious!  I got lots of raves on this one!"
4470,12847,2001-10-18,5,"You're right the rosemary is great with lamb.  Made this last night and served the lamb with Dorothy Park's Lemon Potatoes good combo.  I cut this recipe in half and it worked with no problem.  Adjusted cooking time accordingly.  I agree Lamb must be pink.  Thanks Eve,  Bergy"
21694,10559,2001-11-21,5,Really delicious.  It made the whole house fill up with a great fragrance as well.
21618,10574,2001-10-20,1,Not Impressive
15205,10600,2001-08-23,0,"Marinating chicken using marinade of raw chicken is very, very unhealthy and poses a salmonella poisoning risk.  Never use reserved marinade from raw chicken to flavor cooked chicken."
19135,10600,2001-10-07,4,Since I was unable to broil I put the chicken with all the marinade in an oven bag.  It was very tender and flavorful.  I also used less feta during the cooking time and put more of the fresh on top.  Although cooking it my way it did not brown as it would under the broiler so if you go my way serve with tomato-rice pilaf and bright green broccoli!
9121,10577,2001-08-23,5,Think there's enough garlic in this dish?  YES!!  Deelish!!!
13713,10620,2001-08-05,5,"These are so tasty! For vegetarians, they are a great alternative to the traditional stuffed pepper recipies, which almost always have meat in them. The red bell peppers are so much sweeter than the green ones and are perfect match with the mexican flavoring. E:0)"
6357,10606,2001-08-05,5,Wonderfully wonderful and lovely to the taste buds! A real treat to the tongue! But watch the belly!!
24133,10628,2001-11-20,5,"My husband loved the flavor but said they were a little mushy cooked for 15 min, so now I just store them in the frig. instead of processing them"
25998,15518,2001-12-12,0,"I will try recipe this weekend.
It sounds yummy"
25115,13566,2001-12-26,5,I like this BETTER than pumpkin pie!  It seems sweeter.
26674,15846,2001-12-19,5,"I'm originally from New England, and, have a wee bit of Irish in me.  My mother, who was German and English, fixed our corned beef and cabbage exactly the same way when she used store bought corned beef.  However, the old English corned beef is soaked in brine.  You can use any kind of beef, such as chuck, sirloin, or fresh brisket, not an expensive cut.  Wash it in cold water, put in pot big enough so that it can be covered with cold water, add 1 box of un-iodized salt, cover, put in refrigerator for 3 days.  Turn a couple times during three days. (72 hrs. is sufficient, but, a few more or less won't matter.)  Meat will be grayish in color, but, this in no way affects the flavor. On cooking day, rinse off salt, put in pot and cover with fresh cold water.  Bring to boil, then, lower heat to a simmer.  No spices are added, just all the veggies incl. onions, taters, cabbage, turnip,and, maybe a parsnip or two, after the meat is fork tender. At this point, I remove the meat from pot, cover with foil, and put aside, then add the veggies. The only thing we ever drank with it was beer, and it's one of our very favorite dishes.  Just one comment.  I believe the person who wrote this meant ""gristle"", not grizzle.  Grizzle happens to be my daughter-in-law's maiden name.  We always had rye bread with it to soak up some of the pot liquor.  I've made myself hungry, so must go and get something to eat."
4470,10720,2001-09-04,4,Very nice chicken and you are right it is so easy.
15572,10757,2001-08-29,5,Excellent side dish on a hot summer''s day.

Keep up the good work Mr. Lane.

16870,11085,2001-08-29,5,I had suggested to this genuis the addition of bell pepper..His Stomach must be made of steel to digest all that hot stuff.
21752,11085,2001-10-28,4,"I tried this, but doubled the bread and put the sandwiches into one of those electric triangle sandwich toasters.  I thought it was great, but it was too spicy for my husband.  His loss!"
24548,13961,2001-11-25,5,"This the best turkey I have ever made!It was so juicy,and the flavor was excellent.I skipped the lemons and just stuffed the bird."
16140,13117,2001-10-25,5,"This was lovely ,real comfort food!I used italian seasoned tinned tomatoes and  black pepper flavoured feta cheese."
8836,10806,2001-11-20,4,"Yummy.  I added green peppers, fresh basil, and other spices.  I prefer a bit more ricotta, but this recipe is a great template to begin with."
4470,10860,2001-08-15,5,I BBQ shrimp often using a very similar recipe.  The only difference is that I add whole garlic cloves on the skewers between the prawns. I love garlic!
15368,10860,2001-10-03,5,Found that the 2 hour marinade was too long - it started to cook the shrimp.  I only let it go 1 hour. Best grilled shrimp recipe so far.
8000,10813,2001-09-10,4,"It take a little longer, but I jusr blanch them, and steam them.
Nice, easy sauce.  Excellent."
14295,10836,2001-08-21,5,this recipe was easy and my kids loved it! It was delicious.
21479,10836,2001-10-17,5,omg how nice was that !!!!!!!!!! but i had to change the banana's to strawberrys as my partner michelle doesnt like banana's!!!!!!
23746,10836,2001-11-17,5,"Very delicious! I loooove the flavor! Just to say one thing, if you use skim milk instead of 2% 
or whole milk, there is then no fat! Just a helpful tip to those who are on diets!"
18391,15035,2001-12-19,1,"This recipe did not work for me .. it was so soggy I couldn't even turn it over .. I tried baking some in the oven without success .. I don't think I'll try it again ..
"
8000,10850,2001-11-14,5,"Excellent.
I would clarify the butter.
Don't forget the black pepper, and a pinch of cayenne pepper."
25663,12933,2001-12-08,5,"For an apple drink, this is the best. Very good for your  home, it smell's good. Easy to make. Healthy for your body, I rate it a 10."

17026,11009,2001-08-31,3,"The recipe instructions mention adding milk, but milk is not a listed ingredient.  I'm sure my muffins would have turned out better if I'd known how much milk should be used for this recipe! [Editor's Note: We contacted the author and added the ""1 cup milk"" as a result of this review.  Thanks!]"
20758,12223,2001-10-17,4,"I like to add cheese -- bleu, cheddar, parmesan, asiago, your choice.  Another good mix-in is dried chives.  When I can't get them, I substitute french onion dip for the sour cream.  It jazzes things up a little."
4470,14216,2001-11-25,0,I usually use 1 6 oz jar of artichokes in oil and two in water. Drain them well.  If you can't find the small jars of artichokes in water substitute a 10 oz tin for the two 6 oz jars.   Bergy
19246,10964,2001-11-05,1,I baked the cake in a fan forced owen for 15 minutes and it turned too crusty and hard. I could not cut it into two so I had to decorate the cake as it is. I don't know what but something went wrong somewhere!
19593,11004,2001-11-10,5,"Sounds really goooood--something 'I'

16777,11032,2001-11-09,5,"I just made this soup to serve my dinner guests.  They all loved it, and everyone wants the recipe!!! Including my mother-in-law, so it has to be good, although I will be the one making it again for her!!! Just change the metric measurements over on this website. I wouldn't make any change to the recipe, it was perfect."
19043,11106,2001-09-26,4,This was pretty good.  Went well with potatoes Elizabeth.  I added some jalapenos to the recipe to spice it up a bit and left out the sour cream.  I cooked the meat mixture earlier in the afternoon but I don't recommend that because it dried it out too much.  Thanks for the recipe
20677,12490,2001-10-16,5,"One of the best crockpot recipes yet!! Fast, easy and delicious."
13483,11236,2001-11-14,5,"The only thing I did different from the recipe was to add more garlic and some tabasco sauce.
Very good recipe whether you are camping or not!!:-)  Will certainly do this simple but great recipe again.  Thank you Eve"
6357,14475,2001-11-19,5,"WOW! This is quite similar to Lali's Homemade Chocolate Pudding, just the brandy new in here, so I know beforehand, I'm going to love it and thank you for another yummy dessert!!!"
10216,14475,2001-11-20,5,Ok...I'm going to make this with half 99% chocolate and half 85% chocolate. I'll tell you tomorrow how it turns out... I think it should be delicious! I might add one or two drops of mint essence :)
11954,11243,2001-09-04,0,"Excellent, and easy to prepare."
18847,11193,2001-09-28,5,Very tasty -- it was a hit with young and old alike. Its also easy to prepare.
11613,11193,2001-10-09,4,very good and simple to make.  It was a little salty.
15609,11201,2001-10-02,5,I did not use the tomato paste.  Just all the fresh stuff.  This was very good that way too.
23029,11290,2001-11-12,4,Nice flavor in the sauce.  I cut back on the onions.
18888,11304,2001-09-11,5,"This is also our family favorite.  Over the years, I've experimented with the ingredients...one favorite variation is to substitute hazelnut flavoring (like the kind of syrup you'd use in coffee) instead of vanilla...in the cake and frosting, both.  I also have toasted coconut and sprinkled on top of frosted cake.
This cake freezes well."
21694,12888,2001-10-20,5,Absolutly wonderful. I love feta cheese by the way.
10216,12888,2001-10-22,0,"The onions are from this recipe (found it!!):

5285,12888,2001-12-12,5,"Watch that you don't grill it too long on the last step - I burnt the feta. Still, this was delicious, looked classy, etc. It's even fun to cook!"
22015,12265,2001-12-10,3,"I was disappointed in the flavor.  I thought that they would have a lot of orange taste and would be sweet.  They weren't.  However, it does have possibilities.  I am going to play with this recipe and maybe double the oranges and the sweetner to see if I can produce what I was expecting when I tried this one."
2312,15654,2001-12-26,5,"Mmmm, French toast and egg nog: two great tastes that taste great together.  Baking is easier than frying and you use less fat, which helps make up for the fat that there is egg nog in the mix.  Really great.  Easy. It was a perfect Christmas breakfast.  Used a jelly roll pan and the loaf soaked up all the sauce overnight."
25745,12544,2001-12-10,4,"quick, easy & good"
6357,11388,2001-09-06,4,It''s wonderful! I love the sound of the walnuts cracking in the mouth!
12657,11388,2001-11-17,2,"This recipe seemed to be missing something. The amount of oil was too much, and it made the rice rather sticky and greasy. A tastier, and possibly healthier substitution would be to use about 1 to 2 tsp butter instead of the 1 1/2 tbsp oil for the saute. You could also garnish with chopped corriander (cilantro) leaves for a little more flavour."
19702,11459,2001-09-23,5,This recipe was absolutely fantastic.  I had never had anything quite like this before and it was delicious.  This is a great dish for something to eat on the go or you can forgo the chicken and leave it as a vegetarian dish.  It was excellent I highly recomend it.
4470,11486,2001-09-07,5,WYBI (Would you believe it) I do this same thing except maybe a different cheese and instead of Olive oil I use a wee bit of the anchovie oil. Congrats on your spot in the top ten- Go for the TOP you deserve it.
16140,11532,2001-09-21,4,I love Kahlua and the addition of it in this mousse was wonderful

24590,14258,2001-12-16,5,"Excellent - Sweet, then a hint of heat!"
1634,12000,2001-09-27,4,"New cooks might want to know that bell peppers can be roasted by sticking  them with a long fork and holding them over a flame until the skin is charred. Then put them, while still hot, into a closed brown paper bag and the steam will loosen the skin. Red Bell Peppers are a little sweeter than the green ones, but also more expensive. A frugel cook can use the green peppers and add a little sugar to the dip."
9690,12080,2001-09-27,0,This went fast at a recipe exchange. This one I enjoyed the most

20151,12213,2001-10-15,3,"fast and easy, but using premade frozen chicken cutlets makes for a fast food like meal.
would def. be better to use fresh, home made chicken cutlets, but then this wouldn't be so fast & easy to make, would it?"
18660,12232,2001-12-06,5,"I just made this soup last night and it was wonderful. The smokey flavor of the ham hocks adds just the right touch. For the base, I added 6 cups low fat chicken broth and then added 6 cups water. I also added thinly sliced Kielbasa sausage during the last half hour, for my husband the carnivore! We dunked bits of Foccacia in ours."
21487,15055,2001-11-30,5,I love  the Chipolte restaurant so I can't wait to try this recipe. I think adding some garlic would be great too! Thanks for this one!
13483,12350,2001-12-20,5,Anything with ice cream seems to rate a 5 star with me.  This was so easy and good.  I did not bother with the crumbled candy bar topping.  Just wasn't necessary I thought.  This will be repeated often.  Such and easy concept yet I did not think of it!!!  Glad you posted it.
16140,12466,2001-10-09,4,"My sons loved this,very quick ,simple and easy.I served them with a sweet and sour dip.I think I,ll double the amount next time as they went so quickly."
20371,12466,2001-11-08,5,"This was so easy, and so wonderful. I let the chicken strips soak in the ranch dressing for about 4 hours in the fridge before I coated them. Made for less work at dinner time. I will definitely be making these fingers many more times!"
23303,12520,2001-11-13,0,I have tried this recipe and others for stir fry and the beef always ends up tough  i really dont know what i do wrong   what cut of beef should i use  i have tried rump steak  how long should i fry before taking it off

19447,12522,2001-10-15,5,"I tried this recipe today - making it for someone else - but absolutely had to take some home for myself!!  It was not only ""world famous"" it is ""out of this world famous!!""  I cooked it a bit longer to really crisp it up - and changed it to two servings - but still used enough chicken to fill up an 8 x 10 baking pan.  I think I used more sour cream than called for in my scaled down recipe too - but - really and truly it is ""to die for!!!""  He's not lyin!!"
21565,12522,2001-10-18,5,"This is an ideal recipe because it's simple, yet delicious. Even my picky boyfriend loved the dish."
21992,12522,2001-10-24,5,"This is truly to die for. It is very simple to make and perfect for the times when you want good, satisfying, comfort food - but can't spend all day in the kitchen. This is a dish that has quickly become a favorite in my house."
16140,12522,2001-10-28,5,"Wonderful Recipe,I,ve made this twice the second time I added about 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans to the cracker mix ,it made a nice variation."
20893,12522,2001-11-01,5,I prepared this dish last night for dinner.  It was absolutely delicious!  I reduced the amount of butter for us and it was great.  The sour cream really keeps the chicken moist and the breading was just right to add good flavor.
17608,12522,2001-11-06,5,"This, I must admit is very good.  I used crushed pretzels instead of the crackers and shredded parmasan.  My fiance loved it.  I was a little worried it would be to heavy because of all the butter, but after about 2 bites, I didn't care anymore!  Good good good!"
12129,12522,2001-11-07,4,This was really good and unlike any chicken recipe I've had before.  I like cooking it a little longer so it gets pretty crisp.  I also didn't use quite as much butter as it calls for.  I served it to my kids with chicken rice a roni and green beans and they loved it!  It's a winner!
7108,12522,2001-11-09,5,"This recipe was easy to make, and tasted great.  Next time I would bake it for a bit longer to make it a little more crispy."
13301,12522,2001-11-12,2,"PERSONALLY, I did not enjoy this dish.  The flavor of it did not thrill me, but I gave it two stars because it was the most tender chicken I have ever put in my mouth!  Wow."
23594,12522,2001-11-14,5,"I have had chicken many different ways, but when I had this delicious wonder, I was more than impressed. I really enjoyed it with the Yogurt and Ritz crackers, and would highly recommend this to anyone who wanted a delicious meal. He is truly a culinary artist!"
18297,12522,2001-11-14,5,This was soooo good. I have been looking for something different to do with chicken. I loved it and so did my family.I cannot wait to share this with my mother.
20371,12522,2001-11-16,5,"Well, add me to the fan base! Made it tonight and my family all agreed it was wonderful. Ran out of marjoram so topped it up with thyme; don't know if this contributed but I noticed a taste similar to turkey stuffing. Next time I will cut down on the butter, as I think less would still work. This recipe is a definite keeper!"
20929,12522,2001-11-16,5,"This was really great.  My family loved it !!  The chicken was very moist and tender but I only used two rows of crackers and had some left over and reduced the butter by a 1/4.
I will definately be making this again, and again and again.  Thanks for sharing it."
20159,12522,2001-11-25,5,"""The Best"" says my husband - who usually complains about having chicken ""again?"".  I used fat free saltines - 1 stack to abt. 1 lb chicken.  Didn't have Marjoram or Tarragon so used Thyme and Rosemary - no complaints!  Also used only 1/2 cup of butter - 1/2 stick in the pan prior to cooking and 1/2 stick to drizzle chicken with after coating.  Still very very good!Will try fat free sour cream next time."
21613,12522,2001-11-27,5,very very very good and naughty...
24071,12522,2001-11-27,4,"I am definately a rookie when it comes to the kitchen, but I made this dish for my family last night and they loved it!  It was very easy and tasted great.  The chicken was flavorful and moist and went great with black beans and rice.  In order to cut some of the fat, I used light sour cream and less butter and it still turned out great."
9466,12522,2001-11-30,4,Very nice.  I used cajun seasoning (emeril's essence) instead of marjoram and this gave it a little kick.  I also cooked it for 30-35 min which made it very crispy.  try it with ranch chip dip as a dipping sauce.
20214,12522,2001-12-04,4,"Very yumpy!!  Both the adults and the kids
enjoyed this!!  I cut down on th amount of butter a little, but used more sour cream and kept the breasts whole.  I will me making this dish again-Guaranteed.  Thanks for the great recipe Steve!"
23267,12522,2001-12-13,3,"I did not like the taste that tarragon added to this recipe.  I was completely turned off by the flavor, but I guess that wasn't the recipe's fault but the tarragon's.  I would like to maybe try this recipe again and use the marjoram. I will cut back on the butter next time because I found the recipe a bit greasy."
23139,12522,2001-12-13,4,This was Very good. I used sour cream and Chicken in a Biskit crackers. I also left my chicken breast whole in error but all turned out very good! I did not care for this chicken reheated however. The crackers got a bit soggy when microwaved for leftovers. So be sure to eat it all up the first time  because it is SCRUMPTIOUS!
18660,12522,2001-12-15,2,"My family didn't care for this dish at all.  We ended up eating at Kentucky Fried Chicken. The chicken was tender, but not very tasty."
16909,12522,2001-12-16,5,Tried this recipe tonight and it is great. My son loved it too and he's not much a chicken eater. I will be fixing this recipe often. Thanks..
26683,12522,2001-12-22,4,The chicken was very tasty & tender...but the recipe called for way too much butter.  I would cut it back to 1/2 cup next time...and bake it 20 minutes longer to crisp it up.
26998,12522,2001-12-25,4,Just made this and my family really liked it.  It's a keeper!
24957,12522,2001-12-31,1,Recipe was easy to make but my husband and I did not like the flavour and found it to be too rich.  Would not make it again.
20429,13274,2001-10-29,5,My mother helped me make the slaw for the hamburgers because I've never canned anything before. We have eaten these at the pool room when we go to visit my grandmother. They are really good! This recipe tastes like what you get in the pool rooms.
22015,12590,2001-11-09,4,This takes quite a bit of work but the taste is worth it.  I probably though will skip the nutmeg the next time since I am not a big fan of it's flavor.
23293,12655,2001-11-10,4,delicious
21752,12592,2001-11-05,3,That's a lot of cheese for such a small amount of pasta!  No wonder Reagan has Alzheimer's!  I upped the pasta to a full pound and added a dash of paprika for flavor.  Even with the mustard it was a little bland.
21752,15862,2001-12-26,5,"MG -- thank Cousin Shirley for me, this was a huge hit at our house.  I used frozen corn, half of it partly pulped in the food processor, 2 whole orange sweet peppers, a whole onion, and added lots of cheese to the mix as well as on top.  I've already had a request to make this again since the leftovers are all gone.  This goes great with some fried sole fillets, mashed potatoes and a cold glass of chocolate milk on the side!"
21295,12657,2001-10-15,5,Excellent recipe....
20371,12657,2001-10-20,5,"Made this tonight with a slight modification: used strips of skinless boneless chicken breasts instead of drumsticks and used a combination of carrots, green beans and snow peas instead of only carrots. It was easy and delicious; I will make it again. I just wish the ""sauce"" was a little thicker, so I will use more cornstarch next time and likely cook it uncovered near the end."
10649,12657,2001-12-05,4,Very yummy. I like hot food so I added hot american mustard and it gave it a nice little bit of spice.
21618,12805,2001-10-20,1,Not Impressive
16673,12868,2001-10-28,5,I used Old El Paso brand Fajita Seasoning (low sodium one).  This is a good wrap.  I added avocado to mine just before wrapping it up though.
22015,12761,2001-12-10,5,These are wonderful and the smell in the kitchen was awesome.  Couldn't wait for them to cool down.  I will definitely be making more of these.
9869,12761,2001-12-23,5,"Absolutely delicious, made these today to include on our nibbles table for Christmas. 
And the smell while in the oven was divine.  "
21618,12803,2001-10-20,5,Very Impressive
22995,13704,2001-11-06,5,"If Elvis loved it, it has to be good.  Seriously it sounds just like what I make, it's very good."
22130,13704,2001-12-11,5,My husband considers it a dessert!  He loves it.  It is very good!
21752,12946,2001-11-12,5,"I made a vegan version of this with Tofutti cream cheese and non-dairy whipping cream, and every single piece was eaten!  Lennie, you are making me fat!"
13670,15758,2001-12-15,5,"Delicious salad. I added some mandarin oranges, well-drained, for variation."
6357,14370,2001-11-18,5,"I liked the name of your creatively thought of recipe. I made it after dinner tonight and love it. Its something my tastebuds are thanking you for:) I used 4 tsps. of chocolate syrup and 1 1/2 of coffee. Besides this, I added 2 tsps. of sugar as well. Mom loved it too. Thank you for sharing this, its lovely!"
16459,14689,2001-11-28,5,I had to make this using regular cream cheese because I just can't go fat free. But Man was this good. I don't know if it was because I'm on a red pepper kick or what. I just really loved it.
20159,14689,2001-12-03,5,This was very good - I used real cream cheese as well and a blender set on puree.  Better after letting it sit in the fridge for a few hours so it can set.  Great taste!!
9869,14689,2001-12-04,5,"Made this for a pot luck birthday lunch I went to today, I didnt use lite cream cheese either, and sprinkled dill on top. Served it with an assortment of yellow bell pepper, small white button mushrooms, carrot sticks, celery sticks and courgette sticks. Sat back and watched peoples reactions when trying (there was about 100 there) and heard some satisfied 'ooohs and aaahs'"
4470,14689,2001-12-04,5,"Great recipe! Iused it as a sauce over cauliflower & broccoli , baked in the oven MMMMmmmmmm Thanks Cheers Bergy  Watch for recipe"
6836,14689,2001-12-25,5,"I also made this recipe using regular cream cheese, and added a couple of teaspoons of hot sauce for a little extra zip.  This dip goes very well with crackers & raw veggies--this dip was a big hit at my holiday party - I highly recommend!"
20159,14995,2001-12-03,4,"Great recipe - my husband surprised me by making these for me on the sly...halved the recipe - 3 chops & marinated them 12 hours, then grilled.  Only thing was he used white wine vinegar by mistake instead of white wine (we didn't have any white wine anyway). They were still great.  Pretty moist.  Next time we'll try baking them in an oven bag."
9869,14995,2001-12-05,3,"I used the oven bag method for these, found them to be a little dry."
21752,13065,2001-11-18,5,"This is a very filling meal!  I added some hot pepper flakes to my plate, but my Brit BH preferred it just the way it was."
25222,13065,2001-12-06,3,I found this to be a little bland.  I may add some hot sauce to give it a kick.
16140,13112,2001-10-25,4,"This was great,I pureed the tomatoes before adding everthing else.It was nice,quick and easy!"
21694,12909,2001-11-20,4,"These were good, but I would leave out the ginger and the cornstarch."
21967,13150,2001-10-29,0,This is really quick and good
21295,12965,2001-10-22,5,Excellent......real good taste...
19437,12965,2001-12-06,5,"Yummy thought this recipe was great Dave....

Very easy to make..........


Thanks"
2312,12980,2001-12-08,5,I love homemade cranberry sauce and all the extra dried fruit in this version made this recipe a great one.  I could just eat it by the spoonful.  Definately making it again!
26022,12980,2001-12-31,5,"I didn't end up with enough because the large group of friends who came over when I served the first jar hinted strongly, VERY STRONGLY that they'd love to have some too. The recipe is simple (compared to other chutneys I've made) and yummy. . ."
16459,12972,2001-11-20,5,Oh my Sam wasn't this just wonderful?
25656,12972,2001-12-08,5,"we ate this when we went to see sam a couple of weeks ago and it is superb.
It was gorgeously gooey."
22644,13173,2001-11-08,5,I couldn't get the date honey but regular honey worked just fine.  We used more red wine than called for in the recipe.
18226,2862,2001-09-18,4,Easy to fix; other than peeling all those shrimp. Very light sauce (no heavy creams or butter). Probably pretty good for you too! My 2 year old even liked it...
23957,14129,2001-12-29,5,I have been looking for this recipe for years.  We lost all our Scandinavian recipes when my grandparents passed.  We used to have this all the time when I was a child.  At least once a week.  Usually served with sausages.  Thanks so much!
20371,13745,2001-12-13,5,"These are truly the perfect addition to a xmas cookie tray, although I intend to make these all year long! They're very easy, tasty, and, of course, colourful. I used real butter instead of margarine, and let the dough chill in the fridge for 20 minutes before shaping into balls. Add this one to your cookbook; you'll love it!"
17608,13745,2001-12-20,5,"I made cranberry, because that's what I had and they turned out great!  I sprinkled them with a bit of powdered suger. Yum.  I see a sure favorite for anytime of year in this recipe."
19995,13723,2001-11-12,5,"I was planning a romantic dinner for my boyfriend and me, but I couldn't decide what to make.  Of course, I turned to the tried and true Recipezaar.  The ricotta spaghetti sounded good, and I knew I could trust Elizabeth's recipes, as I have used them many times before. So I made it, and it was easy and fabulous.  My boyfriend really liked it, too.  Thank you Elizabeth for the romance help.....let's just say I owe you one ;)"
23280,13882,2001-11-17,4,"Can't beat this recipe for fast, easy and edible.  I used frozen,boneless, skinless chicken breast, and shredded them with a fork before serving.   It was great over rice and a side salad.  It heated up even better as leftovers. My husband thinks we can have it weekly."
26006,15602,2001-12-14,5,very simple to make and they taste wonderful.  Can be sprinkled with colored jimmies or nuts after dipping in chocolate to suit the season or mood.  Everyone raved about this cookie.  Will definetely be one of my holiday favorites
23955,14255,2001-11-26,4,"Very flavourful.  I added piri-piri seasoning to the sauce to give it a little bit of kick,"
10216,14434,2001-11-22,5,"6? 6! ay ay ay! I think 3 of theese and I'd be ""screwed up""... very nice combination... Great stuff!"
27122,14501,2001-12-26,5,No need to make a run for the border!
24296,14629,2001-11-25,4,veary  easy  &   fast
27318,14659,2001-12-28,5,"My mother used to make this for us when I was younger.  I love it!  I make it minus the lemon rind..... but who knows?  This is really very tasty!  Rich tasting.  Not as ""livery"" as you would expect."
21730,15797,2001-12-16,5,easy and delicate
21752,15705,2001-12-13,5,"I will admit that I have not made this exact recipe, but we do make this all the time, down to the scallions, and it''s a fantastic breakfast, or as my kids call it, a snackwich.  One thing that we do do differently is that we actually cook the eggs first in the sandwich press, so we get these lovely triangle shaped omelettes that fit perfectly."
18391,14946,2001-12-19,3,"I didn't really like these pancakes .. I wanted to try something a bit different, but regular pancakes are a lot better"
25347,15038,2001-12-28,5,"I personally think this recipe is awesome. My grandmother has made THE BEST Scalloped potatoes since I was little. I mean really good ones. I asked her for her recipe about a year ago only to my surprise to find out this Fannie Farmer was the same recipe, my grandma is in her 80's."
23728,16026,2001-12-26,5,"This was terrific,  worked like a champ!"
16140,1136,2001-09-07,5,"This was very good,i did add more garlic and used Mexican style tinned tomatoes and added 2 finely chopped serano chillis.I also sprinkled a little cayenne pepper over the top as a garnish prior to putting in the oven."
21613,109055,2001-11-12,4,This pasta is going to be a regular on the table. Yum
