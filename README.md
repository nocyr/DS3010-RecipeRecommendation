# DS3010-RecipeRecommendation
GitHub repository for DS3010 final project. We are building a system that recommends recipes based on collaborative and content-based filtering methods.

Note that the datasets uploaded are only a small sample (data points from 2001), as the full datasets were too large with our version of GitHub. However, in our data analysis and modeling, we looked at the full datasets. The full datasets can be obtained through Kaggle, at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions

Our project specifically focused on the RAW_interactions.csv and RAW_recipes.csv files.
